      <description>Over on Facebook the semi-regular &amp;#34;is APCS-A going to Python&amp;#34; once again appeared. I&amp;#39;m not going to get into Python vs Java. Each language giveth and each language taketh away but it got me thinking about the history of language changes.
I titled this &amp;#34;Language choices for APCS&amp;#34; not APCS-A because back in the day it was just APCS. At some point that split with APCS-A being similar to what we have today and APCS-A being that plus a CS2 (data structures) class.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was, I think the fourth, To Code and Beyond conference hosted by Diane Levitt at Cornell Technion. I might blog about a few of the talks but for today let&amp;#39;s start with one.
In spite of my anti College Board bias, I really enjoyed Barbara Ericson&amp;#39;s talk on APCS statistics. Barbara&amp;#39;s been breaking down the APCS numbers for years - how many took the exam(s), how many passed them.</description>
