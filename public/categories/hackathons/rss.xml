      <description>Today I got to be a judge at StuyHacks VIII. This isn&amp;#39;t the first time I&amp;#39;ve been a judge there, I&amp;#39;ve been doing it for a few years now. I&amp;#39;ve also been lucky enought to have been asked to judge a handful of other local hackathons over the years.
StuyHacks is a high school hackathon organized and run by students at Stuyvesant High School. Since it&amp;#39;s run by students, the cast of organizers regularly changes.</description>
