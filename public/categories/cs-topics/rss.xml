      <description>I haven&amp;#39;t been posting about specific CS teaching techniques and lesson content recently. Probably because I&amp;#39;ve been teaching the same classes at Hunter now for the past six years.
Twice a year, Fall and Spring, I teach a recitation for Hunter&amp;#39;s CS1 in C++. In the Fall I also teach a version of their CS0 in Python. My second undergrad CS class in the Spring is Data Structures.
I have some freedom in the CS0 class but that&amp;#39;s more with applications and assignments since the basics are the basics.</description>
