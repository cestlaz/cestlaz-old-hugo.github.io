      <description>So I&amp;#39;m teaching my Ethics and CS class for the first time. I originally designed the course but didn&amp;#39;t teach it the first time around. That honor went to my friend, Master Teacher Topher Mykolyk. He of course did an amazing job - impossible to follow. Fortunately, this is a different cohort so they don&amp;#39;t know how great Topher was for the course :-).
Even though I have the syllabus and Topher&amp;#39;s notes from last time around, first time through is very week to week but I think I&amp;#39;m starting to get my legs under me.</description>
