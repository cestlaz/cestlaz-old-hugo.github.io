      <description>My friend Ria tweeted this earlier today:
If you are a software developer/engineer, please reply with a trait (or traits) that you look for in hiring new engineers (new grads). This can be something you glean from a resume, technical interview, behavorial interview, or all of the above.
&amp;mdash; Ria Galanos (@cscheerleader) October 20, 2019 I&amp;#39;m not hiring for a tech company but I thought I&amp;#39;d share some thoughts anyway.</description>

      <title>On Technical Interviews And Diversity</title>

      <description>I recently stumbled upon Laurie Barth on Twitter and noticed a couple of tweets about tech interviews and the hiring process, something I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about recently.
Solid rant. I think the teach to the programming test market already exists. And it’s why interviewers who subscribe to these tactics get upset if a candidate admits they’ve seen the problem previously. Because it ruins the illusion that this is revealing how candidates think.</description>

      <title>Tech Jobs, Diversity, and Equity in the wake of the Amazon/NYC debacle</title>

      <description>I was planning on either following up on how I use GitHub classroom or commenting on the recent NY Times opinion piece on the College Board but the follow up, fall out, and polarization from the Amazon NY thing has been stuck in my head so I thought I&amp;#39;d write a bit more about it.
Like my previous post, this isn&amp;#39;t really about Amazon but rather about the long game, equity, and diversity and how a lot of people are fooling themselves.</description>

      <title>No Amazon HQ2 in NYC</title>

      <description>That was the big tech news today. I know there was a good deal of vocal outrage about the deal but to be honest I was pretty surprised by the news. Normally deals like these get steamrolled through for better or worse.
I have decidedly mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, I have no problem with Amazon - I&amp;#39;ve got a bunch of former students working there. Mostly in Seattle but at least one in NYC.</description>
