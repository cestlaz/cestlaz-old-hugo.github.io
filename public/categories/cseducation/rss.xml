      <description>Lat day of the 2019 NCWIT Summmit. Got up crazy early, got back from my run and saw this when I checked Twitter:
A1: CSTA, Twitter chats like this one, @guzdial and @alfredtwo&amp;#39;s blogs among others. In all cases because those places start from assuming I&amp;#39;m a CS teacher, rather than starting from assuming I&amp;#39;m a teacher who is better at teaching something else. #csk8 https://t.co/6DO77fzq0j

      <description>The state got back to us the other week on our CSEd programs. Still no approval. One of the requirements is that we have 12 graduate CS credits in our program and that in those courses these five major areas:
Algorithms and programming Computing systems Data and analysis Impacts of computing Networks and the internet as described in the K12 CS Framework. Even though many of the items described in the framework fit better in an education side course NY is requiring that it&amp;#39;s all covered in CS courses offered by a CS department.</description>

      <description>Why can&amp;#39;t we use a real language!
This topic has been coming up a lot recently. Now I&amp;#39;m not talking about the Drag and drop vs textual language thing. Let me be clear. To me a Drag and Drop language can certainly be a real language and many are. I also think they&amp;#39;re terrific when used correctly. I just think they&amp;#39;re frequently misapplied in later grades. No, I&amp;#39;m talking about people asking things like &amp;#34;Why do we have to use Java in our class, why can&amp;#39;t we use a real language like __.</description>

      <description>A question that frequently comes up with respect to CS for All is what does it mean? To me it means giving all students some fundamental exposure to computer science so that they can:
Make use of those thinking skills, problem solving approaches, and practical tools regardless of their future paths. Provide a path for the subset of &amp;#34;all&amp;#34; that desire to further pursue computer science. But even with this, how do you do it?</description>
