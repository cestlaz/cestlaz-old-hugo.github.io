      <title>Teachers want to teach AI but how will we teach the teachers?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teach-ai-teachers/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Saw &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.edweek.org/technology/how-young-is-too-young-to-teach-students-about-ai-survey-reveals-differing-opinions/2024/02&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; earlier as posted on Linkedin by Pat Yongpradit of
code.org. According to the article, nine out of ten educators think
that students should be taught how AI works prior to graduating from
high school. How it works, not just how to use it. This is a good
thing. Sure, opinions vary as to when to teach it - elementary, high
school, or across the board but still, a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It did make me think though about a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, in a way this is really just saying &amp;#34;kids should learn computer
science.&amp;#34; This too is a good thing but the bad thing is that a lot of
people talking about learning about AI don&amp;#39;t get this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
AI isn&amp;#39;t some new magic mystically appearing. It&amp;#39;s algorithms applied
on data on computers with a user interface. Sounds like CS to me, more
specifically a subset of CS. Sure the data sets are HUGE and the
algorithms, more complex than the bubble sort but at a technical
level, it&amp;#39;s a next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
AI applications can do some really impressive things but then so could
earlier computer solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
AI can be filled with bias but computer systems have always been
infused with our societal biases (and we have to do better).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
AI can either take away jobs or enhance productivity but the same can
be said with earlier computer innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, the call to teach how AI works is a good one but there&amp;#39;s a level
of concern that people don&amp;#39;t see that in a lot of ways this isn&amp;#39;t a
revolution but a next step and as my readers know, I fell we&amp;#39;ve gotten
some serious things wrong in the roll out of teaching CS, without
acknowledging that this comes from CS begs the question, what will we
do differently, or more specifically better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This brings me to my next thought, and this is the bigger one - if
teachers are going to teach all our students how AI works, how are we
going to teach all those teachers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s clear, at least to me, that the professional development, short
form training model favored by so many for CSforAll efforts is far
from ideal. It sets up content providers and politicians to be able to
say &amp;#34;we&amp;#39;ve trained all our teachers in just &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; years&amp;#34; with &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; being
some small number but the truth is, those teachers don&amp;#39;t really know
what they&amp;#39;re teaching and are doing a disservice to their students in
the long run &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-reference&#34;&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;footnote-reference-1&#34; href=&#34;#footnote-1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We also see Computational Thinking efforts where
elementary school teachers relabel things they already do with CT
labels - debugging for error fixing, for example. This can be a
stepping stone to true CT and CS concepts but I&amp;#39;ve seen
implementations where just the labeling is considered good
enough. Worse, at times the teachers delivering these CT enhanced
lessons aren&amp;#39;t using the CT definitions correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
CSforAll in New York City has been going on for nine years. Some
states are further along in bringing CS to their schools and some
started later. Still, after a decade, we have an extremely &lt;strong&gt;long&lt;/strong&gt; way to
go. The number of high school teachers that have a deep knowledge of
CS and how to teach it still pales in comparison to other subject
areas and while elementary school teachers don&amp;#39;t require the same
depth of knowledge, they, in my opinion, as a group are also far
behind where they should be when CS is a subject equal to all the
others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not blaming anyone for this (other than what I already said about
the acceptance and in fact enthusiasm of the short term PD model) but
rather noting that creating a new subject area from whole cloth where
those you intend to teach it never studied the subject themselves is a
multi decade process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What&amp;#39;s worth thinking about now though, is what are we going to do
with AI? Are we going to double down on short form PD and pay lip
service to this emerging technology? Are we going to make some serious
decisions and decide that some meaty material has to be included in
per service programs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m a skeptic. In a country where public school teaching is regularly
derided and even in New York there&amp;#39;s talk about removing the Masters
degree requirements I&amp;#39;m not hopeful. Will we, as a society, decide to
do what&amp;#39;s right for all of our students or will we pay lip service
while those who are well resources continue to get further ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr class=&#34;footnotes-separatator&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnote-definitions&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnote-definition&#34;&gt;
&lt;sup id=&#34;footnote-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#footnote-reference-1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnote-body&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PD as a first step is often necessary and can be a good start
but without meaningful long form preparation as a follow up it&amp;#39;s pure style over substance] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Hosting an AI panel at Stuy</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/ai-panel/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2024 11:15:47 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/ai-panel/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Went back to school yesterday. Specifically, I was back at Stuy
running an AI panel discussion for the Stuy HS Alumni Association. I
figured it&amp;#39;s time for me to get back in the CS / CS Ed game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Plans started a few months ago when a member of my Stuy CS family
who&amp;#39;s also in the SHSAA board asked about doing something. I was game
but a little apprehensive, mostly because there have been, let&amp;#39;s say,
issues with the way the SHSAA had operated in the past. Still, this
was a new board with a new staff so I figured, worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Turns out the new Alumni Association ED is a former student of mine so
that rocketed the trust level of the association way up and we were
off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Setting up any panel or tech event can be tricky. If you&amp;#39;re doing
something for your own classes it&amp;#39;s much easier - you&amp;#39;ve got a good
idea as to the classes experience as well as interest in whatever
event you&amp;#39;re planning. A panel like this, not so much. I had no idea
on the audience size but since it would be mostly Stuy grads along
with a few Stuy students and a low cost or free event it meant that
the room would be filled with nimble minds. The challenge was that
those nimble minds would be all over the place with regards to tech
experience. I was guessing we&amp;#39;d have adult tech pros and hard core CS
people, students who were into CS just finding their way, adults
wanting to learn more but who had no background in either CS or AI,
and probably a few alumna who just wanted to show up for an alumni
event. Turns out I think I got the audience range right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How to make a panel for that? You want to be able to do something of a
deep technical dive but you don&amp;#39;t want to lose the non-techies. You
also want to spend time on all sorts of societal issues - talking AI
is a lot more than just tensor flow, neural nets, transformers, and
LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I reached out the my StuyCS family, my alumni network for four
specific individuals. Oh, if you&amp;#39;re an AI person and part of the
family and wondering why I didn&amp;#39;t ask you - remember - this was a live
NY event so all you Pittsburgh, Seattle, and California AI folks,
sorry - geography made that decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alphabetically, first up was Ben - he was one of my technical
heavyweights. I was confident he could handle any technical curveballs
from the audience. He also has worked at both large companies and has
built startups so he could also give some management and
entrepreneurial context. Next, Doug - strong tech background but a lot of
experience as a technical manager. Been at a number of major and minor
companies from small to large. I figured he would anchor the
business/manager side.  Eugene was third - another technical anchor to
balance Ben but Eugene has more formal academic training and also
spent his entire career in a single major tech company. Finally,
Jamil who also brought startup and small/mid company experience but
has always been big on civic tech and equity related issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, all four overlapped. I joked that Jamil was the conscience
of the panel but truthfully those societal issues were important to
all of us. Likewise, all have had some managerial experience etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From the limited feedback I got so far, I think the mix worked. We
started &amp;#34;defining&amp;#34; AI, modern AI, LLMs (in lay terms) etc. and then
shifted to issues like the use of other peoples data in training, bias
in AI, and of course, recommendations for the youngsters just getting
started. The audience Q and A got more deeply into these issues along
with future jobs issues and if it&amp;#39;s even worth learning to code
anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I won&amp;#39;t recap all the specifics but a highlight to me was how the
panel painted the picture to show that while AI was new and shiny and
is opening new doors with both opportunities and challenges, at the
core, so many of the important issues are societal based, not
technical. Ben mentioning that in a startup the big cost drivers are still
things like personnel and that we&amp;#39;re still very much in the same
startup/funding/scaling model just with new tech and Jamil and others
emphasizing that it&amp;#39;s not that there are these new potential dangers
with bias, for instance with AI but rather that the bias is already
baked into our system and AI is the next frontier - a wake up call
that we can&amp;#39;t just sprinkle some equity sugar on AI but rather have to
deal with the hard societal issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All in all, I think it was a terrific event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end I had a chance to informally spend time with both panelists
and audience and it was great to see a number of old friends. Between
the panelists and audience, I had students from the class of &amp;#39;95 up to
some of my most recent graduates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was a fun first event to come out of my retirement hibernation. Not
sure whats next but this one was both educational and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AI For All</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pd-ai-for-all/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2020 07:00:01 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pd-ai-for-all/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday we had another Professional Development Workshop for High
School CS Teachers and as usual, I wnat to express my thanks to
&lt;a href=&#34;digitalocean.com&#34;&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; for continuing to provide space, food, and great overall support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This time though, instead of JonAlf and I having
to run the show we had a guest speaker. We were joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SarahEJudd&#34;&gt;Sarah Judd&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;a href=&#34;http://ai-4-all.org/about/what-is-ai/&#34;&gt;AI4ALL&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sarah gave an overview of what AI4ALL was up to and why but the core
of her presentation was taking us through some of the exercises 
they have been developing at AI4All. Specifically, they&amp;#39;re developing
what they call &lt;a href=&#34;http://ai-4-all.org/open-learning/&#34;&gt;AI4All Open Learning&lt;/a&gt; which consists of curricular
materials aimed at high school students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As we only had a short time, Sarah took us on a whirlwind tour of what
they&amp;#39;re building from the baseline concepts of AI that she feels (and
I agree) that every students should know up to specific AI topics like
neural nets. Obviously you can&amp;#39;t cover even a single course in one
evening professional development session but Sarah did a great job
giving both a taste and an overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The activities were all engaging and and covered both ethical/societal
issues as well as the technical/CS. I appreciated that the materials weren&amp;#39;t
presented as canned experiences but rather tools that a teacher would
use to deliver their own experiences. On the other hand I&amp;#39;m skeptical
of the website&amp;#39;s claims of &amp;#34;No AI or computer science experience
necessary.&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;m a firm believer that a CS teacher must know both CS
and how to teach it - maybe not at first due to necessity, but
ultimately. Regardless, Sarah has both real teaching experience and CS
knowledge and I put more faith in what she&amp;#39;s saying than a PR blurb on a
web site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now you&amp;#39;ll notice I haven&amp;#39;t said anything specific about Sarah&amp;#39;s
presentation or AI4All and that&amp;#39;s because Sarah will be giving a
variation of it at SIGCSE in March. If you teach high school and are
going to be at SIGCSE, I highly recommend you check out her session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If not, perhaps I&amp;#39;ll blog more specifics after the event.&lt;/p&gt;
