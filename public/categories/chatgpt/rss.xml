      <description>Just got back from a few much needed days away so it&amp;#39;s time to get to those chatGPT posts.
Last time, I wrote on cheating in general. That seems to be one of the hot points for chatGPT, in fact, the NYC DOE just last week decided to ban chatGPT outright, presumably for that reason. We&amp;#39;ll talk about the student side, both negative and postitive today and the teacher side next time.</description>
