      <title>Rubrics for teacher observations are garbage</title>

      <description>There have been a lot of bad ideas foisted onto educators over the course of my career. One of the ones that always pissed me off was the use of a rubric for teacher observation. Specifically, using the Danielson Framework. The Danielson Framework is a LONG laundry list of topics and concepts and for each a teacher could be rated ineffective, developing, effective, or highly effective.
It&amp;#39;s garbage.
Sure, there are some good things in the framework but using a restrictive rubric to judge a teacher is just a bad idea.</description>

      <title>Do you need to know assembly to be a computer scientist?</title>

      <description>Another recent discussion online asked &amp;#34;do you need to know assembly language to be a computer scientist?&amp;#34;
Sides quickly formed. On one side, it was a strict requirement. Some going so far as saying you had to start with it or at worst a language like C. On the other side you had people claiming that it&amp;#39;s wholly unnecessary for most CS graduates like many of the classes we require of a CS major (I&amp;#39;m looking at you Calc II and beyond).</description>

      <title>How Will Online Influence Teaching</title>

      <description>I always enjoy Fred Wilson&amp;#39;s predictions for the new year over on his blog and this year was no exception.
I was inspired to think a bit on his education prediction:
K12 systems around the US (and around the world) faced with teacher shortages and desperate to erase several years of learning shortfalls, will increasingly adopt online learning services in the school building in lieu of and in addition to in-class learning.</description>

      <title>How The Hash Is Made</title>
      <link>https://newblog/post/how-the-hash-is-made/</link>

      <description>Following up on my last post.
Soon after I read that tweet, I read Julia&amp;#39;s post on hash tables. This got me thinking more about what is and isn&amp;#39;t taught in school. Hash tables were always taught in CS programs but back in the day you might not have used them much after your data structures or algorithms classes. Nowadays you&amp;#39;re much more likely to use them as they&amp;#39;re built in to so many platforms.</description>

      <description>I saw this tweet by Julia Evans the other day.
if you&amp;#39;ve been working in computing for &amp;gt; 15 years -- are there fundamentals that you learned &amp;quot;on the job&amp;quot; 15 years ago that you think most people aren&amp;#39;t learning on the job today?
(I&amp;#39;m thinking about how for example nobody has ever paid me to write C code)

      <title>Hunter College CS Teacher Certification - Final Project Fun Time</title>

      <description>Well, we just delivered the last formal piece of instruction for the summer intensive. Writing this post between visits to breakout rooms as the cohort works on their final projects.
Tomorrow and Thursday will be presentation time. Each group will give spend thirty minutes teaching us all about some topic in CS along with the plan for how we could teach the topic to our kids. We&amp;#39;ve got a few more things to talk about as a group but it&amp;#39;s mostly time to sit back and enjoy the show.</description>

      <title>Hunter&#39;s CS Teacher Certification program Week 2</title>

      <description>Time for some thoughts after week 2.
Since this is the inaugural edition of our program and there was no way to really know what the cohort would be like we&amp;#39;ve been adjusting on the fly. This was expected but we&amp;#39;re finally starting to settle in. We&amp;#39;re still finding more zoom heavy days but as we move towards the end of our data structures segment there should be fewer of those.</description>

      <description>Time for an update on our NY State Teacher Certification Program. We kicked off on Monday. Twenty two students working with three instructors from 9:00 - 3:00 every day. We&amp;#39;ve been using a combination of synchronous with Zoom and async using Slack and GitHub discussions. We&amp;#39;re using GitHub as our main platform.
Day 0 was very Zoom heavy but we&amp;#39;re trying to balance one big Zoom session a day combined with other work so as to minimize fatigue.</description>

      <description>As many of you know, the CS Education programs I designed here at Hunter were finally approved by NY State late last year. We&amp;#39;re planning to get started this summer. I&amp;#39;ve received many questions about the program and will write up the details here sooner or later but one question I frequently get is &amp;#34;will it be offered online?&amp;#34; This is also something I&amp;#39;ve been asked more than once internal to Hunter.</description>

      <title>Predicting Grades</title>

      <description>Just saw this:
Evaluation metric idea: take snapshots of students&amp;#39; grades each week (specifically, the grade they actually see in your LMS). How well do these correlate with your final assigned grade? Were students getting good estimates?
&amp;mdash; Austin Cory Bart (@AustinCorgiBart) May 18, 2019 It made me think of a couple of conversations I had with more senior teachers early in my career.
They&amp;#39;d tell me &amp;#34;by and large, you know what the kids are going to get after a few week.</description>

      <title>Thoughts On Code And Beyond - Computational Thinking</title>

      <description>The theme of this year&amp;#39;s To Code and Beyond was Computational Thinking. Mark Guzdial gave the keynote. While the talk isn&amp;#39;t currently online, check out this talk that Mark gave last March. It&amp;#39;s not the same but the second halves are and well worth a look.
In the first half, Mark talked about other types of &amp;#34;thinking.&amp;#34; Scientific thinking, engineering thinking and even historical thinking. All had a good amount of overlap with both each other and with computational thinking even as we haven&amp;#39;t yet settled on what computational thinking actually is.</description>

      <title>Is There a First Grade Machine Learning Achievement Gap?</title>

      <description>Today was the fifth &amp;#34;To Code and Beyond&amp;#34; - a one day conference hosted at Cornell Technion and once again Diane Levitt put together a great show. The theme was Computational Thinking and the day consisted of a variety of talks, panels, and activities. I plan on writing about one panel in particular but for today I wanted to address something that came up as a question. One attendee asked a panel about the achievement gap - the fact that when the CS movement got started in NY some of the more innovative and interesting work was being done with some of our most vulnerable students.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve never been much of a New Years person. I get up really early and so don&amp;#39;t usually stay up late and more to the point, as any teacher knows, the year really goes from September through June with that really long much needed weekend that you regular folks call July and August tacked on to separate years.
This whole January first thing is really more of a half time break or perhaps an intermission.</description>

      <description>I spent yesterday evening at the Cooper Union in their Great Hall, a place famous for Abraham Lincoln&amp;#39;s speech that some say propelled him to the presidency.
I was there in the audience watching as the Sloan Foundation and the Fund for the City of New York awarded seven public school teachers with an ward for &amp;#34;Excellence in the Teaching of Science and Mathematics.&amp;#34;
I was their to see my friend Dave Deutsch, a long time public school physics teacher receive the honor.</description>

      <description>I saw this tweet the day along with the ensuing thread:
Seriously, who emails a professor with words like &amp;quot;u&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;plz hlp&amp;quot;? Am I allowed to put language in my syllabus that penalizes students for obnoxious, intentional misspellings? Maybe: -1% to your course grade multiplied by the edit distance of the word with its correction?
&amp;mdash; Austin Cory Bart (@AustinCorgiBart) November 30, 2018 I wanted to reply but as usual, I decided to reply in a blog post so that it doesn&amp;#39;t get lost in the Twitterverse.</description>
