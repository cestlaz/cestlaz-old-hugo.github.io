      <description>Since posting about my new Pinebook Pro I&amp;#39;ve gotten a few questions as it pertains to teaching CS so I thought I&amp;#39;d give a quick update.
In terms of software here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve actually gotten working: libreoffice (comes preinstalled) C/C++ toolchain (manjaro package install) Java (manjaro package install) Emacs (built from scratch and manjaro install) NetLogo (had to customize the startup script as per the NetLogo FAQ) Racket (had to compile from source) I&amp;#39;ve also heard the VSCode works with no issues.</description>

      <title>Pinebook Pro - an $200 Linux Laptop</title>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m writing this on my new Pinebook Pro - a $200 ARM based Linux laptop. The Pinebook Pro comes from the Pine64 project. As you could figure out, they do the Pine64 which is similar to a Raspberry Pi and they&amp;#39;ve got some cool projects. In addition to the Pinebook pro they&amp;#39;ve also got the Pine Tab and Pine Phone and more. Now, you&amp;#39;re not going to be able to go to their site and say &amp;#34;I need 30 of these for my class&amp;#34; - at least not for the Pinebook pro but it is a pretty cool proof of concept and hobbyist machine and it shows that we could have affordable devices for our schools and less afluent students.</description>
