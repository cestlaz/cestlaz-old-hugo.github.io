      <description>I&amp;#39;m super proud to say that New York City now has state certified Computer Science Teachers!!!!!!
It&amp;#39;s been a long road - really long if you consider I got started on my CS Ed journey decades ago and there&amp;#39;s a long road ahead but we hit a major milestone. I started at Hunter a little over five years ago and creating teacher certification programs was one of the goals. Back then, the state had neither CS certification nor CS standards.</description>
