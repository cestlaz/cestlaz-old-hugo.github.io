      <description>One of our teacher certification cohort members asked for some help on our Slack the other day. It was about a side project - he was learning him so Javascript. It&amp;#39;s always very cool to see teachers exploring things that can help with their craft on their own.
The whole situation reminded me about how important good tooling is and why, in spite of its popularity, javascript has some severe issues as a learning language and I&amp;#39;m a guy that actually likes javascript.</description>
