      <description>It&amp;#39;s almost December which means it&amp;#39;s almost time for Advent of Code 2019. Advent of code is an annual computer programming competition created and ruyn by Eric Wastl. It&amp;#39;s been running since 2015. I&amp;#39;ve written about it before, mostly from a teacher&amp;#39;s point of view (Solve A to Solve B, Data structures and Hidden Complexity, Tools can shape how we think and a few others). Basically, Eric releases one poblem a day at midnight from Dec 1 through Dec 25.</description>
