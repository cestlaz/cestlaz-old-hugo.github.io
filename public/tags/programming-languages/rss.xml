      <description>Last time, I wrote about frustrations in trying to motivate myself to learn ocaml. I could see the strong points but given that I&amp;#39;ve been using Clojure now for a while, it didn&amp;#39;t really hold any value added for me in my current situation.
Next, I thought I&amp;#39;d explore Rust. On the non-functional style, my go to languages have always been Python for scripting and small things and C professionally.</description>

      <description>Now that I&amp;#39;ve done posting about why I&amp;#39;m retiring we can get back to our usual blogging.
I haven&amp;#39;t really done anything technical over the past couple of year. The most programming I did in the past 18 months was a halfhearted effort at the Advent of Code 2021 event last December. I thought I&amp;#39;d see about picking up a new language to change that. In doing so, I was reminded of some of my resistances to learning a new language and how I&amp;#39;ve seen similar from self taught students coming into my classes.</description>
