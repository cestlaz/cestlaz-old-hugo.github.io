      <description>Earlier today I read this post by Eliot Horowitz, founder and CTO of MongoDB.
Eliot titled the post &amp;#34;Innovate vs Appropriate&amp;#34; and talks about the importance of knowing when to come up with something new vs when to use the accepted tool, technique, or method. Eliot, of course is discussing this as it applies to MongoDB and it&amp;#39;s well worth a read but it got me thinking about the ever popular need to &amp;#34;disrupt&amp;#34; education.</description>
