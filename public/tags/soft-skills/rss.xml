      <description>Back in May, I read this post about Angela Duckworth and Grit. Grit has become an education buzzword in the past few years so I figured I should read Duckworth&amp;#39;s book. It took this long because there was a long waiting list at the New York Public Library to get the ebook. I&amp;#39;m still not quite finished with the book but I thought I&amp;#39;d share some of my thoughts on the book and the buzz.</description>
