      <description>Stuart Halloway is a name in the Clojure community. I was rewatching one of his talks this morning and I thought some of you would enjoy it. Lots of gems on approaching programming and development. Nothing radical or new here but lots of good stuff very well presented.

      <description>One of my pet annoyances is how code ecosystems have gotten more and more complex. Sometimes I think tool designers put together build systems to show how clever they are rather than to solve dependency problems as cleanly and simply as possible.
Over the break I wrote GitHub Org Explorer - a tool to help deal with GitHub classroom repositories. It worked but was using &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; authentication where it sent a username and password with every request.</description>
