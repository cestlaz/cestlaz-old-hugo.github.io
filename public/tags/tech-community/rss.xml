      <description>One of my goals when I came over to Hunter was to help establish Hunter CS as the place to be for CS in the city. Hunter already had a solid CS program before I joined but it isn&amp;#39;t well known. It also doesn&amp;#39;t have an established tech culture.
It&amp;#39;s an ambitious goal but if it can be done, what a game changer. A lot of people talk about equity, diversity, and social justice but if we can establish Hunter as the place to be for CS in NY, what a win.</description>
