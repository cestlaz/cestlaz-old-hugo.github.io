      <description>I never do much on New Years Eve. I can&amp;#39;t remember the last time I stayed up until Midnight. It&amp;#39;s just not really a big deal with me. Yesterday, thanks to Natan rushing tickets, I did close out the year seeing the Metropolitan Opera&amp;#39;s new production of Fedora which was very enjoyable.
Woke up late today - around 5:00, went for my first run of the year and did the puzzle over coffee.</description>
