      <description>I was planning on either following up on how I use GitHub classroom or commenting on the recent NY Times opinion piece on the College Board but the follow up, fall out, and polarization from the Amazon NY thing has been stuck in my head so I thought I&amp;#39;d write a bit more about it.
Like my previous post, this isn&amp;#39;t really about Amazon but rather about the long game, equity, and diversity and how a lot of people are fooling themselves.</description>

      <description>That was the big tech news today. I know there was a good deal of vocal outrage about the deal but to be honest I was pretty surprised by the news. Normally deals like these get steamrolled through for better or worse.
I have decidedly mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, I have no problem with Amazon - I&amp;#39;ve got a bunch of former students working there. Mostly in Seattle but at least one in NYC.</description>
