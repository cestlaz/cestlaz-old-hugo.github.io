      <description>Now that high school seniors have all committed to their respective colleges I though I&amp;#39;d share some information on Hunter&amp;#39;s incoming Daedalus (honors CS) cohort.
I joke about the first cohort saying that nobody applied to the program. That&amp;#39;s kind of true. I jointed Hunter a little over three years ago in late January. That was after high school seniors had already applied to college and at that time the program didn&amp;#39;t exist.</description>

      <description>Back in September I talked about embarking on my Fall 2018 HS CS Tour. Since then I&amp;#39;ve visited about a dozen schools. I&amp;#39;d like to thank my friends who helped connect me to schools - particularly Aankit Patel and Diane Levitt.
Even though the original motivation for the visits was to get the word out about Hunter CS and the awesome things we&amp;#39;re doing in the Hunter CS Honors program I always tried to make my talks about something that would be relevant for the entire audience and not just the few that were great fits for my program.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve written before about why Hunter College CS is so important for NYC and I&amp;#39;ve been working hard to develop our Daedalus Scholars honors CS program - a program in which students receive a scholarship along with all sorts of special opportunities to add on to their in class CS education. The program and Hunter CS as a whole have made a lot of progress over the past two years and each year I roll out new special activities and events for my honors students.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I was back on campus for an early orientation session for Hunter&amp;#39;s incoming Daedalus CS honors students. It was the first time all of us got to meet face to face. The students I met with will be my third cohort. I got to thinking how far we&amp;#39;ve come in under three years.
Hunter&amp;#39;s had a strong but little known undergraduate CS program for as long as I&amp;#39;ve known.</description>
