      <description>Just saw this:
Evaluation metric idea: take snapshots of students&amp;#39; grades each week (specifically, the grade they actually see in your LMS). How well do these correlate with your final assigned grade? Were students getting good estimates?
&amp;mdash; Austin Cory Bart (@AustinCorgiBart) May 18, 2019 It made me think of a couple of conversations I had with more senior teachers early in my career.
They&amp;#39;d tell me &amp;#34;by and large, you know what the kids are going to get after a few week.</description>

      <title>Unit Tests Grading Workflow</title>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve talked before about unit testing (here, and here). My premise is that in addition to being an important industry technique, it&amp;#39;s a sound practice for students studying CS. I also contend that it can make grading easier on the teacher. Maybe not as easy as an auto-grader but those have their own problems.
Since I spent most of today grading I thought I&amp;#39;d share my current workflow and how unit tests have made me more efficient.</description>
