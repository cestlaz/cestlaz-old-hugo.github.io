      <description>Last semester I wrote about how I was introducing my students to code review. I thought it worked pretty well and was anxious to try it again.
Well, I did the lesson(s) again this past week and it looks like it&amp;#39;s a keeper. The setup was pretty much the same with some hiccups due to using a new platform. Last semester I used plain GitHub public repos. This time, I&amp;#39;ve been using GitHub classroom which I like very much but I forgot that I made this assignment use private repos which turned out to be a hassle.</description>

      <description>Sometimes professional practices don&amp;#39;t work well in the classroom and sometimes they do. One professional practice that does work well is code review - reading and reflecting on other peoples code.
I&amp;#39;ve had my students do code reviews in the past but this time I did things differently. Here&amp;#39;s what I did and here&amp;#39;s how it went
Two weeks ago my students completed a lab. The lab involved reading in a poorly indented C++ program and spit out a properly indented one.</description>
