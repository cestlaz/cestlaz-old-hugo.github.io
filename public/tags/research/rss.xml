      <description>After reading a couple of comments on my last post where I talked a bit about practitioners vs researchers I thought I&amp;#39;d expand and expound a bit.
While there are education researchers that I very much respect, overall, I&amp;#39;m skeptical of education research. Note that I&amp;#39;m not talking specifically about CS Ed research but rather education research in general.
Let&amp;#39;s go back to the beginning. I entered teaching from industry.</description>
