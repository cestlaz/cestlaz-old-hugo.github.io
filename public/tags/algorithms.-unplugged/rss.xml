      <description>Thks question was posed the other day - how can one get students to truly understand the quicksort algorithm?
I&amp;#39;ve written a few posts about quicksort. The last time I did a lesson writeup on the subject I wrote about first looking and quickselect and then moving to the quicksort. The class was first faced with the problem of writing a routine to find the Kth smallest item in an unsorted data set.</description>
