      <description>If one looks at my twitter feed they&amp;#39;ll notice that in addition to CS Ed, another issue I&amp;#39;m passionate about is school reform or rather resistance to what is popularly known as and mislabeled as school reform. I&amp;#39;m anti vouchers, charter schools, high stakes testing and more. One of the heroes of this resistance is education historian Diane Ravitch. I&amp;#39;m a big fan of Diane&amp;#39;s and she&amp;#39;s one of the true great champions of public schools, kids, and teachers.</description>
