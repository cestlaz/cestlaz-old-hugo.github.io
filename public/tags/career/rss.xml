      <description>My friend Ria tweeted this earlier today:
If you are a software developer/engineer, please reply with a trait (or traits) that you look for in hiring new engineers (new grads). This can be something you glean from a resume, technical interview, behavorial interview, or all of the above.

Why do I mention this? Because I&amp;#39;ve been hearing way too often from young people who are too quick to deny themselves opportunities and too often these are from students who have come from less advantaged backgrounds.
It&amp;#39;s Fall and I&amp;#39;ve been making my rounds visiting local schools to talk to seniors about colleges in general and Hunter CS in particular.</description>
