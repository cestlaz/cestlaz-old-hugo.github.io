      <description>Since Hunter uses C++ as it&amp;#39;s core language, I haven&amp;#39;t used Java much in the past three years. That&amp;#39;s going to change pretty soon. Once we start offering our CS teacher Certificate and Masters programs I&amp;#39;ll once again start teaching with Java as that&amp;#39;s one of the langauges that we want to prepare our teachers with.
That means deciding on a set of tools and so I&amp;#39;ve been spending time evaluating Java programming environments with an eye on the beginner since not only do the teachers I work with have to be comfortable with the tool but more importantly they will have to be able to support the tool for all of their students.</description>

      <description>Two of the hardest topics to make meaningful to students in APCS-A are inheritance and interfaces. It&amp;#39;s not that they&amp;#39;re super difficult topics but rather that they&amp;#39;re not often needed, useful, or superior to not using them on beginner assignments. More often than not the motivation is a bit forced as are the assignments. Inheritance is its own can of worms and to be honest, something I&amp;#39;ve not found to be all that useful or necessary.</description>
