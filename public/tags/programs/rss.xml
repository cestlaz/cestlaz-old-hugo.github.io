      <description>Everybody know&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m the Statler and Waldorf of the CS Education world.
I&amp;#39;ve been known to be &amp;#34;prickly,&amp;#34; which is a nice way of putting it and I&amp;#39;m openly critical of many programs out there.
One program, however, that I very much like is TEALS. They&amp;#39;ve been around since 2009 founded by Kevin Wang, a former teacher. The basic idea was to have tech professionals go to a school on the way to work and team teach a CS class with one of the school&amp;#39;s teachers.</description>
