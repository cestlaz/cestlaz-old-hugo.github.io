      <description>I&amp;#39;ve talked before about unit testing (here, and here). My premise is that in addition to being an important industry technique, it&amp;#39;s a sound practice for students studying CS. I also contend that it can make grading easier on the teacher. Maybe not as easy as an auto-grader but those have their own problems.
Since I spent most of today grading I thought I&amp;#39;d share my current workflow and how unit tests have made me more efficient.</description>
