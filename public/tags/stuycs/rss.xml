      <title>Learning About Startups at StuyCS</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/learning-about-startups/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Most students who study CS in college plan to go into industry in one
manner or another. Unfortunately most college CS programs are still
designed with the assumption that all undergraduate CS majors want to
pursue a PhD. I&amp;#39;ve addressed this periodically here and that&amp;#39;s not the
focus for today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of those who want to enter industry, it seems a fair number are
interested in the startup ecosystem - they want to either be part of a
startup - a small agile effort that they hope can change the world or
even start their own company. Some eventually also want to turn
towards venture capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, if college does a less then ideal job preparing CS majors
specifically for industry, they do less ideal job preparing them to
launch a startup. Before going further, I don&amp;#39;t want to be unfair - a
number of institutions are making efforts to modernize their
undergraduate CS programs and a number of them are doing great jobs -
offering courses in software engineering, teaching the &amp;#34;hidden
curriculum&amp;#34; and integrating modern software engineering sensibilities
like unit testing into core CS classes but change in academia is slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the startup side, things are even further behind. There are a
number of boutique masters programs in &amp;#34;tech entrepreneurship&amp;#34; that
have popped up but financial aid can be sparse so many are, like code
schools, workforce programs for the rich. For many of the programs I
know of, I&amp;#39;m not sold on the quality. Some are good, many are meh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In undergrad, if you&amp;#39;re a CS major you&amp;#39;re not really going to learn
about startups and the startup ecosystem. I supposed if you&amp;#39;re a
business major you might, but then you won&amp;#39;t develop the tech skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since retiring, I&amp;#39;ve started to work more closely with the Stuyvesant
Alumni Association and I&amp;#39;ve always had a tight bond with my former
students and I wanted to do something to start to address this
problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Last night was the first step. It was only a single small firs step,
but it&amp;#39;s something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In partnership with Stuy&amp;#39;s Alumni Association, we put on an
event. First I reached out to my grads and asked for both founders and
funders. People who&amp;#39;ve started a company and successfully raised money
for it and people who&amp;#39;ve selected promising startups and provided said
funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since it&amp;#39;s the holiday season, a number of my New York VCs couldn&amp;#39;t
make it as they had other holiday events to attend but we had a solid
dozen volunteers available and I&amp;#39;m sure I could have gotten more if I
had worked at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then we had the attendees. I thought the event would mostly appeal to
younger Stuy grads. Those in college and a bit beyond but there was a
pretty wide spread of ages and even a number of current Stuy students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We split them up at tables, gave the funders and founders some loose
guidelines to follow - key points to address and let the founders and
funders lead small group conversations. We also had open mixing and
networking before and after the small table discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I&amp;#39;m still collecting feedback, overall I think the event went
really well. People got to learn about the startup journey, some
specifics from specific stories, got advice from knowledgable people
who&amp;#39;ve both been there and done that and walked away with some new
connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It wasn&amp;#39;t perfect. It would be better if we had more balance between
founders and funders - we had 2/3 or 3/4 founders and a 50/50 mix
would have been better. Reshuffling the tables would also have been a
good idea but, overall a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One thing that I really love about the StuyCS community is that we can
do these events on almost any tech topic and really, many other topics
as well. Last year I wanted to pull together an AI panel and instantly
had far too many volunteers for panelists. This time, founder and
funders and again no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now the next step is to refine this event and figure out follow ups as
well as other future events.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reunion Season</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/reunion-season/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Thanksgiving is reunion season. Stuyvesant and I&amp;#39;m guessing other high
schools traditionally hold their reunions, at least the five and ten
year ones over the holiday weekend. It makes sense since grads who&amp;#39;ve
moved away might still be coming to town for family celebrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This year, I was invited to the Stuy07 ten year reunion. I considered
crashing the Stuy97 20 year but it was at the same time and too far
away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m always really flattered and honored when I get a reunion
invite. I&amp;#39;ve been to my share but I was never the hip popular teacher
that gets invited to these things. On the other hand, I&amp;#39;m sincere,
honest, and loyal so when I do connect with students it&amp;#39;s meaningful
and lasting. As one of my students remarked when I was nominated to be
graduation speaker a few years ago and I doubted I would be elected
&amp;#34;hey, you lead the most popular cult in the school&amp;#34; and I guess in
some way the community is a cult, or as I&amp;#39;d rather say, a family. In
any event, whenever I&amp;#39;m invited to a reunion I make my best effort to
attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I find the role of faculty at reunions as somewhat amusing – we&amp;#39;re
something of a prop. The grads are there and should be there to
reconnect with each other. The teachers are and should be secondary.
From my point of view, there are three groups of students. The ones
that are now part of my alumni family - now friends who I&amp;#39;m in touch
with to varying degrees, the ones that never knew me and the ones that
knew me a bit. For the second and third groups, as a faculty member,
I&amp;#39;m there to remind them of the glory days as a representative of the
institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As with all reunions I had plenty of &amp;#34;I was never in your class
but …&amp;#34; conversations. I also a number of &amp;#34;I majored in
fill-in-the-blank but just found my way back into tech
so….. thanks.&amp;#34; I love these conversations - it gets someone
new into &amp;#34;the family.&amp;#34; I also had one conversation that was really a
nice ego boost. One of my guys introduced me to his wife. She
immediately exclaimed &amp;#34;it&amp;#39;s so great to finally meet you, he talks
about you all the time!&amp;#34; That was kind of weird until she went on
&amp;#34;…every time he talks about Stuy.&amp;#34; That made more sense. It&amp;#39;s like
all those times when me and my buddy Ben would reminisce about our
Junior High school days and we&amp;#39;d always get back to talking about
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2012-05-09-my-favorite-year-teacher.html&#34;&gt;Herb&lt;/a&gt;, one of our best and favorite teachers and a major influence on
me while Devorah looked on confused. Eventually she met and got to
know Herb and it all made sense. Another grad added &amp;#34;you think we all
forget about you but you come up more than you know&amp;#34; so I take that as
a shout out to all of the teachers out there who never get to hear
back about how much they are remembered and appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With tools like email and Facebook it&amp;#39;s easier to remain connected to
former students but it&amp;#39;s always nice to connect in person. For the
StuyCS family, we have our periodic meetups but for the rest, I love
being included in class reunions and hope to be invited to more in
years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
