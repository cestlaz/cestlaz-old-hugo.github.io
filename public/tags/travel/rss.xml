      <title>Philadelphia Freedom</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Time for another travel post. Figured that by posting here there&amp;#39;s
more permanence and search-ability than a Facebook or other post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, Devorah and I are spending a few days in Philly. We started coming
down here a year or so ago and this is our third trip. It&amp;#39;s a nearby
getaway from NYC and we&amp;#39;ve got friends here that we rarely get to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sports fans notwithstanding I&amp;#39;m surprised that Philly doesn&amp;#39;t get more
love from NYC people looking for relatively nearby travel. It&amp;#39;s under
2 hours away, is a very walkable city, and has the things we love, in
no particular order - food, culture, history, art, architecture, and
neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We did a lot of the mainstream history, rah rah America stuff in our
last couple of visits along with such gems as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.barnesfoundation.org/&#34;&gt;Barnes Foundation&lt;/a&gt;
and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.easternstate.org/&#34;&gt;Eastern State Penitentiary&lt;/a&gt; so this time we&amp;#39;ve been looking at
some less mainstream attractions so I thought I&amp;#39;d share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the way in, we stopped at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.americanswedish.org/&#34;&gt;American Swedish Historical Museum&lt;/a&gt; in
South Philly. Great museum in a gorgeous 100 year old building. The
museum covered the early Swedish/New World history (including, for New
Yorkers like me, interesting tie ins with Peter Minuet and Peter
Stuyvesant) but had so much more. They had a room on inventor John
Ericsson and another on Swedish Nightingale, Jenny Lind, brought over
to the USA by P.T. Barnum and played all over including at Castle
Garden (nee Fort/Castle Clinton) in lower Manhattan. Also lots more
including some sketches by painter Anders Zorn and a whole bunch of
artifacts. There was also a special exhibit on Swedish candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The highlight for Devorah was an exhibit on Swedish weaving:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/philly/swedish1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/philly/swedish1.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/philly/swedish1.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/philly/swedish2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/philly/swedish2.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/philly/swedish2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/philly/swedish3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/philly/swedish3.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/philly/swedish3.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today we started off at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nps.gov/inde/planyourvisit/benjaminfranklinmuseum.htm&#34;&gt;Ben Franklin Museum&lt;/a&gt;. Pretty cool but
nothing unexpected. I recently watched Ken Burn&amp;#39;s documentary on
Franklin so I was up on his life but it&amp;#39;s a nice little museum with
some neat artifacts and it was only $5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next up was a real gem - the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencehistory.org/&#34;&gt;Science History Institute&lt;/a&gt;. This free
museum has artifacts and the development of science from alchemy
through modern day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/philly/science.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/philly/science.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/philly/science.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/philly/science2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/philly/science2.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/philly/science2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A special exhibit on dyes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/philly/science-dye.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/philly/science-dye.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/philly/science-dye.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And education in science:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/philly/science-kits.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/philly/science-kits.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/philly/science-kits.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/philly/science-books.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/philly/science-books.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/philly/science-books.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, Devorah found the knitting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/philly/science-knitting.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/philly/science-knitting.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/philly/science-knitting.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We were a little &amp;#34;museumed out&amp;#34; by the end so will have to come back
but this is a must visit museum!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next up, a pit stop. We ended up at &lt;a href=&#34;https://shanecandies.com/&#34;&gt;Shane Confectionary&lt;/a&gt;. America&amp;#39;s
oldest continuously running candy store. They had some old-timey
candies but they&amp;#39;re really a chocolate place, making products from
bean to bar so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/philly/shane3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/philly/shane3.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/philly/shane3.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/philly/shane2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/philly/shane2.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/philly/shane2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Had a great conversation with the person
working there, purchased way too much chocolate and headed off to our
next stop - another gem - &lt;a href=&#34;https://museumforartinwood.org/&#34;&gt;The Museum for Art in Wood&lt;/a&gt; - also another
freebie ($5 suggested donation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/philly/wood.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/philly/wood.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/philly/wood.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/philly/wood3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/philly/wood3.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/philly/wood3.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/philly/wood4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/philly/wood4.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/philly/wood4.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, lunch time. We went to a hand pulled noodle shop that we had
visited two years ago. Really tasty and super inexpensive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/philly/noodles.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/philly/noodles.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/philly/noodles.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our final stop was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://fabricworkshopandmuseum.org/&#34;&gt;Fabric Workshop Museum&lt;/a&gt;. Lots of interesting
stuff going on behind the scenes but for tourists like us, think of it
as a general art gallery where the medium is fabric. There were a
couple of really neat exhibits and again, free ($5 suggested). Another
winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We then picked up doughnuts for later at the Reading terminal market and
wandered back to our AirBnB. On the way, we saw a number of murals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/philly/mural.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/philly/mural.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/philly/mural.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And also these people holding up a skybridge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/philly/bridge.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/philly/bridge.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/philly/bridge.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Spent the evening relaxing, having reheated leftovers for dinner from
yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hope you enjoy some of these less known Philly attractions when you
get to town. Tomorrow we&amp;#39;re going back to the Philadelphia Museum of
Art for their special exhibit on Mary Cassatt and will also probabyl
hit the Rodin museum and then we&amp;#39;ll figure out Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Charleston days 3 and 4 - Plantation visits and more food</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/charleston34/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 15:11:50 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/charleston34/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As I mentioned in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/csed-podcast-teaching-with-masters/&#34;&gt;CS-Ed Podcast&lt;/a&gt; post, yesterday was a
washout. Seriously scary storms. We ended up spending the entire day
in the hotel but was able to get to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.middletonplace.org/&#34;&gt;Middleton Place&lt;/a&gt; for dinner. The
original plan was to do the entire plantation during the afternoon but
that was a no go. Instead we got there a little before our reservation
time which did let us wander the grounds a little before heading in to
the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/day34/middleton.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/day34/middleton.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/day34/middleton.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We did this based on advise of friends and I highly recommend it. We
weren&amp;#39;t able to explore everything they have to offer but we got the
flavor of the gardens and landscaping and didn&amp;#39;t have to pay any
entrance fee. The meal was also extraordinary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today was much better. We headed off to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.magnoliaplantation.com/&#34;&gt;Magnolia Plantation&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s
on most of the &amp;#34;must see&amp;#34; in Charleston lists kown for beautiful
gardens. It was nice and there was some history thrown in,
particularly when taking their included tour of the slave cabins but,
maybe since the flowers aren&amp;#39;t in full bloom yet, I wasn&amp;#39;t
overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/day34/magnolia1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/day34/magnolia1.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/day34/magnolia1.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/day34/magnolia2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/day34/magnolia2.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/day34/magnolia2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The limited parts of Middleton Place that we saw made a stronger
visual impact probably due to the greater amount of terracing and
landscaping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That said, Magnolia boasts a host of gardens incuding a bamboo garden
and a swamp garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Speaking of which, we did end up seeing a plethora of gators. So many
that I started to feel like Mick Dundee (gotta stay with  older
generation references rather than the slightly more contemporary Steve
Irwin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/day34/gator4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/day34/gator4.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/day34/gator4.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/day34/gator3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/day34/gator3.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/day34/gator3.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/day34/gator2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/day34/gator2.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/day34/gator2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/day34/gator1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/day34/gator1.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/day34/gator1.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next up was a late lunch at the Mason Jar by Fatboys, Finally got our
fried chicken fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/day34/chicken.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/day34/chicken.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/day34/chicken.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the big reasons we chose Charleston was for the food. Food,
history, and culture are our big three for vacations. Walk-ability also
comes into play. We ended up at least trying pretty much all the local
food that we wanted to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hush puppies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She crab soup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shrimp and grits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheese grits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fried chicken&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perloo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biscuits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BBQ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fried green tomatos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shrimp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benne wafers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pimiento cheese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pickled okra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to get dinner at a seafood place shortly and then home tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Overall a solid first post-retirement trip.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Charleston day 2 - Wrought Iron and Religion</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/charleston2/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2024 19:04:54 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/charleston2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We started day 2 with a walking tour. We&amp;#39;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;https://freetoursbyfoot.com/&#34;&gt;Free Tours by
Foot&lt;/a&gt; or similar services. No fee or a small reservation fee up front
and then pay what you want at the end. We generally haven&amp;#39;t been
disappointed and also generally end up tipping voluntarily about the
same amount as what we&amp;#39;d pay for a pay up front tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We walked around downtown getting more local and US history and
learning about the city. During one stop at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://charlestonstage.com/about-us/dock-street-theatre&#34;&gt;Dock Street Theater&lt;/a&gt; we
learned about Charleston&amp;#39;s preservation and architectural restoration
efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/day2/theater.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/theater.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/theater.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also discussed Charleston&amp;#39;s history of religious tolerance, being
known as the Holy City due to the preponderance of churches and
acceptance of all religions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/day2/church.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/church.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/church.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also got to see a whole lot of wrought iron created by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Simmons&#34;&gt;Philip
Simmons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/day2/iron1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/iron1.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/iron1.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/day2/iron2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/iron2.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/iron2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/day2/iron3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/iron3.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/iron3.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After lunch, Devorah and I visited &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kkbe.org/&#34;&gt;KKBE&lt;/a&gt; - America&amp;#39;s first reform
Jewish congregation. They give an interesting tour. Jews started
appearing in Charleston in the late sixteen, early seventeen
hundreds. They were of Sephardic descent. This was similar to the
first Jews in New Amsterdam who came for religious tolerance (but as a
New Yorker, I have to say that they got to us first :-) ). The first
reformers from Germany came to Charleston in the 1820s and KKBE, the
first Reform Congreation in America was formed in 1841.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/day2/synagogue.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/synagogue.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/synagogue.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is interesting for two reasons. First, this congregation,
according to our docent didn&amp;#39;t specifically follow the lead of the
reform movement in Germany. Second, Isaac Mayer Wise is normally
credited with starting the Reform Judaism movement in America when he
settled in Albany in 1846, some five years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After the tour, we walked around, saw this storefront:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/day2/scribnered.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/scribnered.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/scribnered.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Neither of us knew what the old Kress building was, now housing an H&amp;amp;M
but Devorah and I both thought &amp;#34;Damn, they were Scribnered&amp;#34; (if you
know, you know).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It turns out that S.H Kress owned a series of &amp;#34;five and dime&amp;#34; stores
and one was in this building. The store there was the cite of a noted
civil rights protest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also saw some fountains in public parks including of course, the
Pineapple Fountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/day2/fountain.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/fountain.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/fountain.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/day2/selfie.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/selfie.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/selfie.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We ended the day passing the historic marker commemorating &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Smalls&#34;&gt;Robert
Smalls&lt;/a&gt;. How is there not a movie about this guy? I won&amp;#39;t tell the
story here but if you don&amp;#39;t know who he was go read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Smalls&#34;&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/day2/smalls.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/smalls.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/day2/smalls.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finished off with dinner back at the Glass Onion which was again
superb. If you get down to Charleston, defiantly have a meal or two
there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tomorrow was supposed to be plantation day but there are supposed to
be nonstop thunder storms so it looks like we&amp;#39;ll probably go museum
hopping instead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Visiting Charleston</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/charleston/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Depending how you looked at things, I started my retirement this past
Fall. Part of the plan was for Devorah and I to travel a bit more -
something we rarely got to do when we were younger. I did have a great
trip with Batya to Holland and Belgium but Devorah and I, other than a
couple of weekend getaways, weren&amp;#39;t able to go anywhere. We planned to
finally have a trip in January but I broke a toe. Then there were a
few other niggling things that prevented getting away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, this week, we made it - our first retirement trip, and
spanning our anniversary no less!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We decided on Charleston South Carolina. Why? Well, why not. We wanted
to hit it in January since it would be somewhat warmer than NYC. We
figured that it wouldn&amp;#39;t be too hot visiting now in early March - it
would be alike an early Spring for us. Besides, at least on paper,
Charleston checks a lot of our travel buttons - history, food, culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our first stop after flying in and lunch was &lt;a href=&#34;https://southcarolinaparks.com/charles-towne-landing&#34;&gt;Charles Towne Landing&lt;/a&gt; - Charleston&amp;#39;s
birthplace. Beautiful day, beautiful ground to walk around and our
first taste of Charleston history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
From there to our hotel. Dinner was at a local place - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ilovetheglassonion.com/&#34;&gt;The Glass
Onion&lt;/a&gt;. Really exceptional. We started with boudin balls then I had the
shrimp and grits and bread pudding for dessert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/boudin.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/boudin.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/boudin.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/shrimp.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/shrimp.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/shrimp.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/bread-pudding.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/bread-pudding.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/bread-pudding.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Devorah had the gumbo dinner. Super highly recommend. We might go back
tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We started today at &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Sumter&#34;&gt;Fort Sumter&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously a lot of American Civil War
history but also earlier stuff and later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/sumter.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/sumter.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/sumter.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the afternoon we went to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.charlestonmuseum.org/&#34;&gt;Charleson Museum&lt;/a&gt; for lots of local
history. They also have a natural history exhibit with a giant sloth
that I&amp;#39;m pretty sure is bigger than ours in Natural History:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/sloth.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/sloth.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/sloth.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and also a quilting and abstract art exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then on the way to the City Market, we stopped at Peace Pie for a
snack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/peace-pie.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/peace-pie.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/peace-pie.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nice place - custom ice cream / cookie sandwiches. Like Glass Onion,
also highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The City Market was pretty cool - lots of crafts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/seder.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/seder.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/seder.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, before heading home, we checked out their U.S. Customs House. Nice
to contrast it to our Customs House on Bowling Green and it&amp;#39;s
predecessor - Federal Hall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/customs.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/customs.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/customs.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Overall a great day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The only two downers were when we passed a store with lots of anti
Biden T-shirts and also when we found out that the Civil War museum on
top of the City Market is run the Daughters of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Daughters_of_the_Confederacy&#34;&gt;United Daughters of
the Confederacy&lt;/a&gt;, fortunately, we decided to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For dinner, we got our South Carolina Barbecue at Swig and Swine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/charleston/bbq.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/charleston/bbq.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/charleston/bbq.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tomorrow, a walking tour and Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Hague and an extra day</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/hague/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 11:18:26 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/hague/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Last day of the trip we decided to take a day trip to The Hague. On
the way we passed through Haarlem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/hague/haarlem.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/hague/haarlem.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/hague/haarlem.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For some reason I couldn&amp;#39;t get this song out of my head&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kIFN13-a1iA?si=mKvczkvG-QG_6WJP&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We had some time to do some wandering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/hague/hague-canal.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/hague/hague-canal.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/hague/hague-canal.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/hague/palace.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/hague/palace.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/hague/palace.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and even stumbled upon their Chinatown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/hague/chinatown-hague.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/hague/chinatown-hague.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/hague/chinatown-hague.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
but the reason for the trip was the Escher museum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/hague/museum.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/hague/museum.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/hague/museum.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cool museum in a beautiful mansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/hague/echser1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/hague/echser1.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/hague/echser1.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/hague/escher2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/hague/escher2.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/hague/escher2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It had tons of Escher&amp;#39;s work along with his story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/hague/escher3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/hague/escher3.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/hague/escher3.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/hague/escher4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/hague/escher4.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/hague/escher4.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I particularly liked that it had a lot of works that weren&amp;#39;t the usual
tessellations and impossible figures but of course it had those as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/hague/escher5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/hague/escher5.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/hague/escher5.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/hague/escher6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/hague/escher6.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/hague/escher6.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Getting back to Amsterdam we wandered around for a final time and
found their Chinatown as well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/hague/chinatown-amsterdam.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/hague/chinatown-amsterdam.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/hague/chinatown-amsterdam.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, we settled in to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We were supposed to come home today so we got to the airport nice and
early. No problem, at least until we boarded. Three hours later it was
determined that the plane had a bad part and they didn&amp;#39;t have a
spare. Even if they did it would have taken a few hours to replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, we&amp;#39;re spending another night in Amsterdam. Just at a hotel airport
so that&amp;#39;s a little annoying. Not really the worst thing in the world
though. The hotel is fine, I&amp;#39;m assuming dinner and breakfast here will
be as well and these things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was just hoping to get back home to Devorah and Natan after two
weeks and Batya&amp;#39;s probably sick of me already.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amsterdam days 3 and 4</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/amsterdam2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2023 09:35:10 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/amsterdam2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We started walking from our hotel to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en&#34;&gt;Van Gogh&lt;/a&gt; museum. On the way
we passed the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cowmuseum.amsterdam/&#34;&gt;Cow Parade&lt;/a&gt; store. This was pretty cool since we remember
the Cow Parade from back when it was in New York decades ago. Big
fiberglass painted cows at random spots in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/cows.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/cows.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/cows.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Van Gogh museum was pretty amazing (and also had wood
floors). While most of his best known works might be in other museums
around the world there were plenty of great ones to view and admire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/van-gogh.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/van-gogh.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/van-gogh.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There were also plenty of work from his contemporaries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/monet.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/monet.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/monet.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was particularly interesting to see things like a gallery of his
influences or walls with his works surrounded by similar works by his
contemporaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Like the Rijksmuseum this is a must see. We did hear a couple comment
though while standing online that it always sells out so maybe book
tickets in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From there we wanted to see the Ann Frank house&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/ann-frank.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/ann-frank.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/ann-frank.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With so much else to do we decided not to book the tour in advance and
that we&amp;#39;d just walk by. We already knew the story so thought we&amp;#39;d
rather spend the time in the WWII Resistance museum and the Jewish
Museum to learn about things we were less familiar with but would walk
by the house to see it and the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the way we needed sustenance so we sought out a highly recommended
cookie shop but were thwarted by a &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/cookies.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/cookies.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/cookies.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It looked like it would be well over a 45 minute wait. Sorry, we don&amp;#39;t
do that anymore. We found something else, walked by the Ann Frank
house, did some more wandering, had a great light lunch then took a
break back at our hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then the Jewish Museum. It had two parts with two additional ones
opening in March - the museum, on the site of former Ashkenazi
synagogues, the Portuguese Synagogue across the street and the two to
come pieces, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jck.nl/en/location/hollandsche-schouwburg&#34;&gt;Hollandsche Schouwburg&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jck.nl/en/location/national-holocaust-museum&#34;&gt;National Holocoust
Museum&lt;/a&gt;. The next post will cover the Portuguese Synagogue but to be
honest, the museum didn&amp;#39;t thrill either of us. The general Judaism
section was fine but not inspirational and the organization had you
jumping from station to station in what appeared to be random
order. They had some interesting artifacts and we learned a bit but it
wasn&amp;#39;t super engaging to us. The Holocaust section also was pretty
subdued. To be honest, the WWII Resistance museum painted a better
picture of the Holocaust as did the Brussels museum. I&amp;#39;d also rank the
NY and DC ones better. As to the straight Jewish part we also liked the
Brussels museum more and I&amp;#39;ll put in a plug here for the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://theweitzman.org/&#34;&gt;Weitzman Museum&lt;/a&gt; in Philly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In all fairness though this isn&amp;#39;t counting the Portuguese Synagogue
which was included in admission but we couldn&amp;#39;t go to yet since it was
closed for Simchat Torah and who knows what the forthcoming two sites
will add to the overall experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Staying on our cultural theme, we&amp;#39;ve been noticing many bagel shops in
Amsterdam so we thought we&amp;#39;d try one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/bagel.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/bagel.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/bagel.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We ended up taking out form &lt;a href=&#34;https://soupenzo.nl/&#34;&gt;Soup En Zo&lt;/a&gt;, a really good soup place
and pairing the soups with Bagels from Tony&amp;#39;s NY Bagels across the
street. The soups were great and the bagels were surprisingly
good. Not too large, good chew - better than some lesser NY ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That was it for day 3. Day 4 started with the Amsterdam
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hetscheepvaartmuseum.com/&#34;&gt;Maritime Museum&lt;/a&gt;. Really interesting. Some good history of the region
as well as boat and boat history. I really liked the modalities
used. Many galleries combined wonderful art - paintings in particular
to tell the story of Amsterdam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/maritme.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/maritme.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/maritme.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They also had a replica of an old 18th century trade ship that you
could explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/smallroom.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/smallroom.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/smallroom.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Pretty cramped particularly when you consider that statistically
people form the Netherlands are the tallest in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They also had old maps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/map.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/map.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/map.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/maps.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/maps.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/maps.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ship models:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/gig.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/gig.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/gig.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For lunch we then walked out to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java-eiland&#34;&gt;Java Eiland&lt;/a&gt; where we passed the Meta
offices but Batya didn&amp;#39;t go in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/meta.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/meta.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/meta.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And then back near the Hotel to finally visit the Portuguese Synagogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/synagogue.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/synagogue.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/synagogue.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/synagogue2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/synagogue2.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/synagogue2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Wow. While we were disappointed in the Jewish Museum, this part, which
was right across the street made it super worth it. You basically
walked around the outer perimeter of the site going in and out of
buildings where various religious functions occurred and got to hear
about the function and specific history from past congregations. We
also went in to explore the sanctuary. Again, wow. Big, beautiful,
candle lit (that is, no electricity) and in fact is still functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As much as the previous days museum visit was meh, this pushed the
overall experience over the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s it for today except for a new place for dinner which we&amp;#39;ll head
out for soon. Tomorrow, the plan is to go to the Hague for the Escher
Museum and then Wednesday, back to NYC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Final leg of the trip in Amsterdam. Train ride and hotel went smoothly
but we were hungry so got a quick bite across from the Rembranthuis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/rembranthuis.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/rembranthuis.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/rembranthuis.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After some wandering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/market.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/market.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/market.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
we found our way to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.verzetsmuseum.org/&#34;&gt;WWII Dutch Resistance Museum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Great place to go if you want to be both proud and inspired and
depressed at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It contained propaganda from both sides&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/giraffe.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/giraffe.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/giraffe.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and relayed the horror and tragedy that occurred during the Holocaust
highlighting the brave acts of many to try to save lives as well as
the stories of those who acquiesced and for the most part, regretted
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It left an impact and if you&amp;#39;re in Amsterdam I highly recommend it,
particularly give the direction of things with the Republicans in the
United States these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dinner after that was a real treat. Batya and I got dinner with my old
student Artem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/artem.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/artem.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/artem.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Artem graduated Stuy in I think 2000 and I was marginally in touch but
hadn&amp;#39;t seen him since the early part of this century. When I announced
to my alumni community that I was heading to the Netherlands and
asking for recs, Artem chimed in and we coordinated. Such a treat to
reconnect with a former student in person. To be able to see him doing
well in life so many years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We got dinner at Entrepot and it was one of the best meals I&amp;#39;ve had in
years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/dinner.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/dinner.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/dinner.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That was it for day 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Day 2 started with another Sandeman tour. Got an overview of the city
and learned some interesting things. One stood out. We learned about
these &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolperstein&#34;&gt;Stumbling Stones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/stumble-stones.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/stumble-stones.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/stumble-stones.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
placed in front of houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/ss-building.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/ss-building.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/ss-building.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
memorializing victims of the Holocaust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also stopped by the former home of the Dutch West India Company&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/west-indies.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/west-indies.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/west-indies.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and talked about Dutch colonial times including New Amsterdam. It was
cool that our guide was into the Amsterdam/New Amsterdam thing and was
currently reading &amp;#34;The Island at the Center of the World&amp;#34; and had it
in his bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After that lunch at a pancake restaurant recommended by Artem. It was
in a repurposed carousel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/carousel.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/carousel.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/carousel.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl&#34;&gt;Rijksmuseum&lt;/a&gt;. Many amazing artworks including
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl&#34;&gt;The Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; but here is a less famous one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/riijks2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/riijks2.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/riijks2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All I can say is amazing place. Also props to the designers on the
wooden floors - much easier on the feet than stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a final treat we saw &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.grachtenrace.amsterdam/&#34;&gt;De Grachtenrace Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; - a rowing race in
the canals. We wanted to catcht it but didn&amp;#39;t know exactly where or
when it was running - just the day. We saw around 20 boats race by
right after we left the museum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/rowing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/amsterdam/rowing.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/amsterdam/rowing.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Batya and I did this type of rowing and racing withe the &lt;a href=&#34;https://villagecommunityboathouse.org/&#34;&gt;Village
Community Boathouse&lt;/a&gt; out of pier 40 when she was at Stuy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That was it for our first couple of days in Amsterdam with a lot more
to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antwerp in 24 hours</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/antwerp/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Heading to Amsterdam this morning and we&amp;#39;ll be here until mid next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We spent yesterday in Antwerp but for a while we didn&amp;#39;t know if we
were going to get there. Unbeknownst to us when we planned our trip,
yesterday was the season&amp;#39;s first general strike in Belgium. When we
found out in Brussels we weren&amp;#39;t sure we&amp;#39;d be able to get out of the
city at all but it turned out that while the local trains would be out
the intercity ones were going business as usual. Since we couldn&amp;#39;t get
to the required train station easily our host Helen drove us be she
had to do so before work. This meant that we arrived in Antwerp at
around 8:00am. Not a big deal. It was too early to check into our
hotel but we were able to leave our heavier bags and set out for
breakfast and a day of exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start, even before that, we came in to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerpen-Centraal_railway_station&#34;&gt;Antwerp Central Station&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/antwerp/train1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/antwerp/train1.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/antwerp/train1.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/antwerp/train2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/antwerp/train2.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/antwerp/train2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s really amazing. The original station goes back to the mid 19th
century with the current one replacing it around 50 years later. The
facade and entry are gorgeous but going back to the track area is
equally amazing. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerpen-Centraal_railway_station&#34;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; has more and better images so
check them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There was also this elevator status wall noting the levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/antwerp/zero-index.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/antwerp/zero-index.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/antwerp/zero-index.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Gotta love the zero indexing of the floors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After breakfast we wandered around&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/antwerp/building.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/antwerp/building.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/antwerp/building.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/antwerp/buildings.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/antwerp/buildings.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/antwerp/buildings.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and among other things found this, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brabo_Fountain&#34;&gt;Brabo Fountain&lt;/a&gt; in front of city
hall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/antwerp/statue1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/antwerp/statue1.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/antwerp/statue1.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/antwerp/statue2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/antwerp/statue2.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/antwerp/statue2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Very cool. We also passed the cathedral seen in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the side, we saw these builders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/antwerp/builders.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/antwerp/builders.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/antwerp/builders.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and realized why cathedrals, including our local St. John&amp;#39;s the
Unfinished take so long - the builders are made of bronze and don&amp;#39;t
move!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was on our way to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Het_Steen&#34;&gt;Het Steen&lt;/a&gt; castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/antwerp/selfie-castle.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/antwerp/selfie-castle.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/antwerp/selfie-castle.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It had an old school instagram frame:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/antwerp/insta-castle.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/antwerp/insta-castle.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/antwerp/insta-castle.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/antwerp/insta.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/antwerp/insta.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/antwerp/insta.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Inside was &amp;#34;The Antwerp Story&amp;#34; which had a nice overview of the city
and you could climb to the top as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From there we tried to go to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://museumplantinmoretus.be/en/content/welcome-museum-plantin-moretus&#34;&gt;Plantin Moretus&lt;/a&gt; museum but were
thwarted - it was closed due to the strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/antwerp/closed.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/antwerp/closed.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/antwerp/closed.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/antwerp/closed-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/antwerp/closed-2.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/antwerp/closed-2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From there it was to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp_Zoo&#34;&gt;Antwerp Zoo&lt;/a&gt; - the oldest zoo in the
country. It was right next to the train station and just 10 minutes
from our hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We saw lots of animals including this meerkat just standing there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/antwerp/meerkat.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/antwerp/meerkat.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/antwerp/meerkat.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He was just standing there on his hind too legs you know, like that
guy - you know the one who stands - Rory Calhoun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And also elephants:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/antwerp/elephants.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/antwerp/elephants.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/antwerp/elephants.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And many more. There was also a nice little aquarium building where we
found Dory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/antwerp/dory.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/antwerp/dory.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/antwerp/dory.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After all of that we went back to the Hotel but they still didn&amp;#39;t have
our room so we wandered some more - by the Ruben&amp;#39;s house which is
closed for renovations and over to a local park. Then back to the
Hotel where they screwed up our room but we did finally get it
partially resolved - at least so that we had a roof over our head for
the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We finished off the day with a pretty awesome Ethiopian meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This morning we got some more chocolate for the road and are now on
the train to Amsterdam where we&amp;#39;ll spend the next five days.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brussels</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/brussels/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Oct 2023 01:29:57 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/brussels/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We spent the last few days in Brussels. Got in on the Eurostar at
around 1:00. We were crashing with a good friend - a teacher who
worked with Devorah back in the day but left NY and is now in
Brussels. The catch was that she wasn&amp;#39;t getting home from work until
5:00 so we had to occupy ourselves until then. Schelpping around
rolling suitcases usually isn&amp;#39;t a big deal but there were two
challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, schlepping around rolling suitcases is much harder on cobbled
streets, particularly when it&amp;#39;s unseasonably warm and most museums -
you know - tourist attractions with coat rooms are closed in Brussels
on Mondays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We ended up at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brussels-comics-figurines-museum.be/en/&#34;&gt;Brussels Comics Figurines Museum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Very cool. The first featured comic strip was &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsupilami&#34;&gt;The Marsupilami&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/brussels/marsupilami.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/brussels/marsupilami.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/brussels/marsupilami.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lots of figurines and a running cartoon. Fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There were lots more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/brussels/comic2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/brussels/comic2.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/brussels/comic2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/brussels/comic4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/brussels/comic4.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/brussels/comic4.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/brussels/comic1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/brussels/comic1.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/brussels/comic1.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some I knew like Tintin and the Smurfs and some I didn&amp;#39;t. Lots of
interesting backstory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My favorite was, of course, Asterix (and of course Obelix):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/brussels/comic3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/brussels/comic3.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/brussels/comic3.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After the museum we puttered around a bit, refueled on a waffle and
made it to our host&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/brussels/waffle.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/brussels/waffle.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/brussels/waffle.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We started off the next day with a free tour. Well, sort of. We went
on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.neweuropetours.eu/brussels-walking-tours/&#34;&gt;Sandeman&lt;/a&gt; tour. They&amp;#39;re free and request you tip based on whatever
value you feel you received. Devorah and Batya have used them before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We started at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand-Place&#34;&gt;Grand Place&lt;/a&gt; talked a bit about it&amp;#39;s and the city&amp;#39;s
history and walked and learned about Brussels for the next almost
three hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/brussels/gp3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/brussels/gp3.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/brussels/gp3.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/brussels/gp4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/brussels/gp4.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/brussels/gp4.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Batya and I both very much enojyed the tour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next up, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kbr.be/en/ &#34;&gt;KBR&lt;/a&gt; museum. This was recommended by a friend. There was
some local history but mostly it was about illuminated manuscripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/brussels/kbr.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/brussels/kbr.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/brussels/kbr.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They had some history on Illuminated Manuscripts as well as on how
they were made and sported an impressive collection. The oldest we saw
was form the 900s. Extremely cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That evening we got dinner with our friend Helen and a bunch of her
colleagues. Helen is now teaching in Brussels so I asked her to set up
a dinner with her CS or related teachers. They don&amp;#39;t strictly do CS,
they do ICT which has some CS and coding in it but also trends to what
we would cover on the CTE side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I loved meeting and talking with all of them. Learned a bit about what
it was like for them and what&amp;#39;s going on in CS Ed in their school,
Belgium and other places in Europe and I hope I was also able to share
some interesting insights form our side. I might blog more about all
of this at some later date but it was really a highlight for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, our last day in Brussels we started at the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brusselsmuseums.be/en/museums/jewish-museum-of-belgium&#34;&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt;
Museum. It covered the expected intro to Judiasm, had a
Holocaust section and a few exhibits by and about Jewish artists from
or related to Belgium. I was particularly interested in the first two
things - I wanted to see how they were covered in Europe. Very
interesting and as with everything else we&amp;#39;ve seen, worth a visit. I
particularly liked the information about development and histories of
some of the congregations that formed in Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the afternoon we decided to go castle hunting with Helen. First up
was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.castles.nl/grimbergen-castle&#34;&gt;Grimbergen&lt;/a&gt;. Cool old castle but mostly ruins. We were able to walk
around and liked it but it was a short stop - not that much there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/brussels/castle1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/brussels/castle1.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/brussels/castle1.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We then found our way to Chateau de Bouchout at Plantentuin
Meise. Cool castle but also in a botanic garden. We walked a couple of
the sections and went through a pretty amazing greenhouse. Plus
teachers got free entry. Another win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/brussels/castle4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/brussels/castle4.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/brussels/castle4.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/brussels/castle3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/brussels/castle3.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/brussels/castle3.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All in all three successful days of touring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We almost had an adventure the next day - this morning on our way to
Antwerp but I&amp;#39;ll save that for the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Utrecht</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/utrecht/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2023 10:38:29 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/utrecht/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
So I&amp;#39;m spending these two weeks vacationing in Europe with my
daughter. She was planning on this trip anyway as part of her work
&amp;#34;recharge&amp;#34; and is taking me along for a first retirement trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, if you&amp;#39;re looking for CS Ed content or Emacs come back in a week
or two since today is all about travel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We spent the last few days in Utrecht. Why Utrecht? Why not. Also
Batya has a friend here that she&amp;#39;s only met virtually through a
writers group and this was a chance for them to connect in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We were of course zonked from the red-eye flight but wandered a bit by
one of the canals and managed to stay up until evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We were told that pancakes are a thing in The Netherlands so decided
on a pancake dinner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/utrecht/dosa.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/utrecht/dosa.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/utrecht/dosa.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well, Dosa and Uttapam are pancakes :-). Don&amp;#39;t worry, we rectified
this yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next day started with a bike tour of the city. I&amp;#39;ve always felt
that touring by bike was ideal. Cars move too fast. Even those busses
and trolleys with the tour guides. You literally only get a &amp;#34;drive
by.&amp;#34; On foot is terrific and we walk miles and miles when visiting new
places but walking keeps you confined to a small area. By bike you can
cover a good amount of ground but you can go slow enough to smell the
flowers. Also stopping and starting is trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We got a good feel for the geography of the city, some history, more
canals (and a fish doorbell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We finished the day wandering around. Saw the Stadhuis (city hall)
which reminded me of the New Amsterdam Stadhuis ruins under 85 broad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/utrecht/stadhuis.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/utrecht/stadhuis.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/utrecht/stadhuis.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also passed a number of places that had New York foods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/utrecht/lox.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/utrecht/lox.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/utrecht/lox.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m always torn when seeing these. On the one hand, I&amp;#39;m curious on a
different cultures take on NY foods but I also don&amp;#39;t want to waste a
meal when I could be getting local stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We got a giant Stroop Waffle instead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/utrecht/stroop.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/utrecht/stroop.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/utrecht/stroop.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next day we had that pancake meal with Batya&amp;#39;s friend and also
went to the Speelklock musem which is all about self-playing musical
instruments. Very interesting. Other highlights is finding some
locally dyed yarn which will later be turned into socks by either
Batya or Devorah and a flock of sheep (sans Wallace and Gromit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/utrecht/pancake.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/utrecht/pancake.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/utrecht/pancake.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today we visited their train museum. We loved it since it was a train
museum but was also reminded of the local history with a sombering
train car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/utrecht/train-outside.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;/img/utrecht/train-outside.jpg&#34; title=&#34;/img/utrecht/train-outside.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A car used on the rail network in Europe during the Holocaust to
transport Jews to the concentration camps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, it brought us down but we were glad it was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
More wanderings brought us back to our Airbnb where I&amp;#39;m writing this
now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tomorrow we head to Brussels to spend a couple of days with an old
teaching friend and then to Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/csta-2019-preconference/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2019 10:41:36 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/csta-2019-preconference/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s Monday morning, 7:45AM local time. Being on East Coast time,
Devorah and I have already been up for about 3 hours, hit the gym and
our first cups of our chosen caffeinated beverages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since it&amp;#39;s not unbearably hot outside  - a cool and dry  80 in the
shade  - we&amp;#39;re sitting outside. Devorah&amp;#39;s knitting another square for
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blanketstatementproject.com/&#34;&gt;Blanket Statement&lt;/a&gt; so I figured I&amp;#39;d write a few words about  what we&amp;#39;ve
been doing here in Phoenix leading up to our starting with our
conference later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Whenever we travel for &amp;#34;business&amp;#34;  I&amp;#39;ll try to tack on a day or so to
try to soak up at least a little local flavor and there&amp;#39;s plenty of
local flavor in Phoenix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After checking in to the hotel we hit the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.phoenix.gov/parks/arts-culture-history/pueblo-grande/&#34;&gt;Pueblo Grande&lt;/a&gt; museum. It&amp;#39;s a
pre-columbian archaeological site. You can learn about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohokam&#34;&gt;Hohokam&lt;/a&gt; who
used to live - see a bit how they lived and the intricate canal
systems they created. The outside path that toured the ruins was about
a half mile walk in the 105 degree hot sun but it was worth it. Inside
there were galleries with a few exhibits and a lot of neat
history. Well worth the visit. We also walked around &lt;a href=&#34;https://heritagesquarephx.org/&#34;&gt;Heritage Square&lt;/a&gt;
which had some original Victorian buildings but I wasn&amp;#39;t really super
impressed - probably had something to do with having by that time been
out in the heat for most of the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, it was up bright and early to check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dbg.org/&#34;&gt;Desert Botanical
Garden&lt;/a&gt;. Wow - this is a must see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;br clear=&amp;#34;all&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Did I mention it was really hot out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When we started at 7:00am it wasn&amp;#39;t so bad out - about 85 and only a
touch humid but after a couple of hours we needed some AC. We
originally wanted to hike over to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g31310-d126770-Reviews-Hole_in_the_Rock-Phoenix_Arizona.html&#34;&gt;Hole in the Rock&lt;/a&gt; but were by
that time leery of the heat so we took a Lyft back into town for some
breakfast.  We chose a place but as we approached there was a long
line outside. Our driver said &amp;#34;I know a much better place&amp;#34; turned off
the meter, and took us to &lt;a href=&#34;http://hob-nobs.com/&#34;&gt;HobNobs&lt;/a&gt;. It was the right choice. Service
was a bit slow but good food in a comfortable environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We weren&amp;#39;t sure what to do next when I noticed Sarah Judd tweed that
the Museum of Musical Instruments was free for teachers. It&amp;#39;s about 30
minutes out of the downtown but we took the trip. I was a little irked
that the web site said that &amp;#34;educators&amp;#34; were free during the month of
July but they didn&amp;#39;t accept my Hunter ID as a teacher. They were
limiting the free admission to K12 teachers. Still, the museum was
terrific. Gotta love a place that doesn&amp;#39;t take themselves too
seriously:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Exhibits on instruments and musicians. If it weren&amp;#39;t at the end of a
long touring day I think we could have spent another hour or two
there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We ended up getting a locally made menorah for Natan before we left:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday concluded at the GitHub for Education reception where I had
a great conversation with Nick Stoyas about his efforts in Chicago to
scale out their CS programs and thoughts on internship opportunities
for high school students. I hope to write more on that later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In about 45 minutes we&amp;#39;ll head out to &lt;a href=&#34;https://heard.org/&#34;&gt;The Heard Museum&lt;/a&gt; which is all
about Native American art and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That should bring us to lunch today and then conference time!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re reading this and at the CSTA2019 - hope you also get or got
to see some sites and swing by the Github booth to say hi. If not, if
you have a chance to get out to Phoenix, preferably in the cooler
months, I would certainly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
