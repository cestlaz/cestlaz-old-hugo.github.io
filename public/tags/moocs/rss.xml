      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; Now that the ML and AI courses are at an end, here are some of the things I would do moving forward.
Both courses already have a basic track where students just watch the lectures and do the in lecture quizzes and an advanced track where students also complete weekly assignments. I think we can be certain that there were students who just watched a few lectures, many who completed every assignment, and those who fell at all points in between.</description>

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; This is the first in a three part series.
Part 1 talks about my take on how the courses were presented.
in Part 2, I&#39;ll discuss my take on how to improve the experience
and finally, in part 3, we&#39;ll look at on line education with an emphasis on the high school market.
As some of you know, I&#39;ve been taking the on line Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence courses offered by Stanford this semester.</description>
