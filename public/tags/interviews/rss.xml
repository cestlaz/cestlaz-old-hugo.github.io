      <description>I recently stumbled upon Laurie Barth on Twitter and noticed a couple of tweets about tech interviews and the hiring process, something I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about recently.
Solid rant. I think the teach to the programming test market already exists. And it’s why interviewers who subscribe to these tactics get upset if a candidate admits they’ve seen the problem previously. Because it ruins the illusion that this is revealing how candidates think.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, I saw a piece on David Heinemeier Hansson&amp;#39;s tweet on whiteboard interviews:
Hello, my name is David. I would fail to write bubble sort on a whiteboard. I look code up on the internet all the time. I don&amp;#39;t do riddles.
&amp;mdash; DHH (@dhh) February 21, 2017 I&amp;#39;m not a huge fan of the whiteboard interview but I think many of the tweets missed the point.</description>
