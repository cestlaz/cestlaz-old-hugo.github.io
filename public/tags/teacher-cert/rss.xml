      <description>We&amp;#39;ve a week to go in the summer intensive part of our CS teacher certification program so after an intense few weeks, I can start to breath a little. There&amp;#39;s still a lot to be done but I feel like I can breath. The first three and a half weeks covered programming and data structures with a bunch of pedagogy mixed in. This meant a lot of day to day adjustment of what we were teaching and how we were teaching it, after all, this is the first time a program like this has ever existed let alone shifted from in person to remote.</description>
