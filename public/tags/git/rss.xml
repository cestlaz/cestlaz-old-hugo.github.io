      <description>Last week I talked about using GitHub issues as a mechanism for class communication. I thought it might be helpful to follow up on it and also felt that a video would be better than text.
So, here it is, 16 minutes on how you can use GitHub issues for class communication. I don&amp;#39;t show examples of everything like @ tagging but I think it shows some of the power of using GitHub and GitHub classroom beyond just a software repo and versioning.</description>

      <title>CSTA 2019 - Using GitHub as a CMS</title>

      <description>With ISTE ending, the next big event for CS treachers is the annual CSTA Conference. I first attended two years ago in Baltimore. Last year the conference, in Omaha was bigger and better in every way imaginable. I expect this year to be the best yet.
I don&amp;#39;t go to a lot of conferences so I don&amp;#39;t have much to compare CSTA with but I like the fact that it&amp;#39;s is about half the size of SIGCSE.</description>

      <title>GitHub Helps Me Help Students</title>

      <description>Earlier today I was reminded why I love GitHub in support of my classes. One of my students posted a question about our current lab. They posted a synopsis of the problem along with the error message.
Since we&amp;#39;re all working on GitHub the student&amp;#39;s work was already up online Since I started using GitHub Classroom I was able to quickly navigate to the repo. This might have been enough but to really in to the students work I cloned the repo and went into Emacs.</description>

      <description>One of the things I&amp;#39;ve heard for years from former students - both those looking for jobs and those looking to hire is that colleges don&amp;#39;t really do a good job preparing students for careers in tech. Sure they teach the algorithms and the theory but ther are a lot of missing pieces, particularly on the practical end. I&amp;#39;m certainly not advocating turning CS programs into coding schools but there are many low cost opportunities to bring practical real world best practices in to the CS classroom.</description>

      <title>Using Emacs 42 - Git Gutter and Time Machine</title>

      <description>One day I&amp;#39;ll do a Magit video but since there are already some good ones out there I thought I&amp;#39;d share a couple of other great git related packages.
The first is Git Gutter which adds markers on the side gutter of your buffer so you know what&amp;#39;s changed since you&amp;#39;re last commit. I pretty much use it exclusively for that visual but it can also be used to cmmit and revert individual chunks of your changes.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Coding or Cheating</title>

      <description>I haven&amp;#39;t been teaching this past semester. That&amp;#39;s why I haven&amp;#39;t been writing much about lessons. I miss working with students but that will resume in the fall and this semester has allowed me to get a jump on new projects.
It&amp;#39;s also allowed me to look at some student issues from a bit of a distance.
One issue that keeps coming up is cheating.
Some of it, classroom cheating.</description>
