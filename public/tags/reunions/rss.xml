      <description>Thanksgiving weekend is also reunion weekend. I&amp;#39;ve been on and off invited to Stuy reunions over the years. Not as often it seems as some teachers but more often than others. I always do my best to attend. I have very fond memories of many students and many classes over many years and think a lot about them so feel very honored whenever I&amp;#39;m invited to one of these.</description>

      <description>Thanksgiving is reunion season. Stuyvesant and I&amp;#39;m guessing other high schools traditionally hold their reunions, at least the five and ten year ones over the holiday weekend. It makes sense since grads who&amp;#39;ve moved away might still be coming to town for family celebrations.
This year, I was invited to the Stuy07 ten year reunion. I considered crashing the Stuy97 20 year but it was at the same time and too far away.</description>
