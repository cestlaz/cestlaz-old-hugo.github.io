      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been seeing some tweets over the past couple of days about the wonders of online teaching. How it&amp;#39;s at least as good or better than in person or how we should have been doing it all along. Rubbish.
If you say that online is better than in person that says more about the (low) quality of your teaching than it does about the quality of online tech teaching resources.</description>

      <description>Every morning one of the first things I do is quickly glance at my emails and other notifications. I really should wait until I&amp;#39;m more awake but old habits die hard.
As some of you know over the past couple of years I&amp;#39;ve been making a series of videos and related post on using my editor of choice, Emacs. I&amp;#39;ve done 48 videos, have over 2500 subscribers on YouTube and people seem to find some value from the series.</description>
