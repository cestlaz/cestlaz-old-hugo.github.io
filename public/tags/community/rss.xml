      <description>Let&amp;#39;s talk about something other than distance learning and COVID-19.
You know you&amp;#39;ve been doing something a long time when you&amp;#39;ve got legends.
Over on my alumni mailing list JonAlf shared a web site showing off what his current students were doing in their computer graphics class. Somewhere in the thread, Con replied:
Someone should put up a video of the fabulous and fantastically famous hand animation called FINGER.MDL. It dates from a little before my time, but stories elevated it to legendary status.</description>

      <description>Austin Cory Bart tweeted this a little while ago.
I don&amp;#39;t always consider how much power I have as a faculty. Right now, I&amp;#39;d really like to expend that power to make my students understand that I don&amp;#39;t want them focused on my course during a global pandemic. Not right now. Later, but not right now.
&amp;mdash; Austin Cory Bart (@AustinCorgiBart) March 13, 2020 While Cory&amp;#39;s right about this it&amp;#39;s also good to remember that as we&amp;#39;re all going remote, focusing on our courses can be important for our students not merely due to content but in this time of uncertainty to have something to focus on to remind us of community and remind us of normal.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, a handful of CS Ed folks got together. One issue we discussed was that of finding CS related events both for students and teachers. One of our conveners, Dan Fenjves of UPPERLINE CODE talked about possibly hosting a central site. Today, Dan announced http://csevents.nyc/. A site where organizers can submit and students and teachers can find upcoming events. Right now it&amp;#39;s NY centric but it does list some events beyond the city.</description>

CSEd people: many have struggled to use Twitter for discussion. How about Twitter for broadcasting, but when replies turn to discussion, we use https://t.co/2oivuriOoU? It&amp;#39;s a better (albeit imperfect) platform for civil discourse. Subreddit mods @AustinCorgiBart @zamansky?
&amp;mdash; Amy J. Ko (@amyjko) February 21, 2020 I&amp;#39;d love to see more traffic there. For full disclosure, I&amp;#39;m one of the moderators but in my defense, I&amp;#39;m not much of a moderator and as Cory said, I too am happy to either keep moderating or to step aside.</description>

      <description>Presenting at CSTA 2020 I noticed a few tweets and posts from people announcing that they&amp;#39;d be presenting at CSTA2020 - the big computer science teachers conference held every July.
A common thread in a few of these were trepidation&amp;#39;s presenters. Excited to be doing this but nervous.
It&amp;#39;s interesting that teachers, myself included, sometimes get nervous before presentations even though we present every day as part of our jobs.</description>

      <description>Out of class student communication is always a challenge. There are plenty of options:
Piazza Facebook group Slack, Discord, or other chat system Discourse, Vanilla or other discussion forum system Mailing list but all have warts. I shared my thoughts on a number of these options a while ago but thought I&amp;#39;d update them now.
Most of my opinions hold form my earlier post. I was using and continue to use a mailing list as I can be pretty sure that students will get the email and they don&amp;#39;t have to go to any outside site or application.</description>

      <description>Two days ago, a teacher&amp;#39;s comment on a frustrating situation made me mad. Yesterday, I got to be part of something that made me very happy. Last night, Devorah and I ventured out to Coney Island to celebrate the twentieth wedding anniversary of two former students. It&amp;#39;s such a joy and an honor to be included in these types of life events and even more so to count the couple and so many other former students and friends.</description>

      <description>For those of you who don&amp;#39;t know, MongoDB is a very popular NoSQL database. NoSQL is an overarching term describing databases that are not relational and don&amp;#39;t implement Structured Query Language (SQL). In a relational database your data is stored in tables with columns - think spreadsheet where each row of the table is a record in the database. You link tables together via a common field or row name.</description>

      <description>One of the side benefits of visiting high schools is that I end up going all over the city. This takes me to neighborhoods that I normally wouldn&amp;#39;t have reason to visit. For a New York History wonk that can be pretty cool even if you just limit yourself to looking at the schools. A few of the schools I visited in the last couple of weeks before the new year were self contained whole building schools:</description>

      <description>Thanksgiving weekend is also reunion weekend. I&amp;#39;ve been on and off invited to Stuy reunions over the years. Not as often it seems as some teachers but more often than others. I always do my best to attend. I have very fond memories of many students and many classes over many years and think a lot about them so feel very honored whenever I&amp;#39;m invited to one of these.</description>

      <title>Challenges of teaching at a commuter school</title>
      <link>https://newblog/post/commuter-school/</link>

      <guid>https://newblog/post/commuter-school/</guid>
      <description>One of the bigger challenges faced at commuter schools is building a feeling of community. Students aren&amp;#39;t on campus every day and come from far afield and even when they are on campus, we really don&amp;#39;t have a CS &amp;#34;hang out&amp;#34; space. The space issue should be resolved soon - we&amp;#39;re scheduled to get a CS student lounge next semester.
I&amp;#39;m finding this to be even more of a challenge this year with my honors students.</description>

      <description>Thanksgiving is reunion season. Stuyvesant and I&amp;#39;m guessing other high schools traditionally hold their reunions, at least the five and ten year ones over the holiday weekend. It makes sense since grads who&amp;#39;ve moved away might still be coming to town for family celebrations.
This year, I was invited to the Stuy07 ten year reunion. I considered crashing the Stuy97 20 year but it was at the same time and too far away.</description>

      <description>At this past year&amp;#39;s CSTA conference, a few of us huddled in a corner voiced a very common lament - &amp;#34;it would be great if more CS teachers blogged.&amp;#34; It really would be. We&amp;#39;re still a relatively small community and while there&amp;#39;s some good conversation going on on mailing lists and on Facebook, those aren&amp;#39;t easily discoverable or accessible and in the case of Facebook, there&amp;#39;s a question of ownership and permanence.</description>

      <description>The CS Educators StackExchange is now in public beta. For those of you who are not in tech, StackExchange is a network of question answering sites. StackOverflow is probably the most famous - many peoples go to site for computer science and programming questions and answers.
During this period of public beta the site will be working on defining itself and also on developing a critical mass of users. I hope the site succeeds and I encourage everyone to check it out, ask questions, answer some and let&amp;#39;s all see where this goes.</description>

      <description>This past weekend was Catskills Conf, one of my favorite events of the year.
Last year, Devorah joined me and also enjoyed the show.
If you know my wife, you know she&amp;#39;s always knitting. Ok, not true, she&amp;#39;s always knitting, spinning, weaving or performing some other form of fiber craft.
I can&amp;#39;t complain. That&amp;#39;s how I ended up with my Kandinsky, Dust Puppy and Yoda sweaters and my awesome Kang and Kodos socks.</description>

      <description>Waking up to a beautiful brisk morning at the Ashokan Center in the Hudson Valley.
Last year, Devorah and I attended the first Catskillsconf, a tech conference in Olivebridge, NY. It was an amazing and unique experience. I can only describe it as Tech Conference meets Summer camp. Where else can you hear talks by people like Dennis Crowley and an alos hear the music of Mike and ruthy.</description>

Last Thursday I spent an afternoon and evening with NYCIST members for a discussion of the state of K12 Computer Science Education in the City.
Most of my work has been with public schools and most of the teachers I know, public school teachers so it was great to make new friends in the Independent school community.</description>

I went to high school with some scary smart people. Never made math team. Didn&amp;#39;t get into honors math. Thought I wasn&amp;#39;t good at it.

      <description>If I look at my leaving Stuyvesant and the NYC Department of Education to join Hunter College as the end of Act I of my teaching career, then our family&amp;#39;s West Coast swing was a nice way to pull down the curtain.
The impetus for the trip was visiting Batya - she&amp;#39;s interning at Facebook this summer and having an absolute blast.
The plan was to spend a few days in San Francisco, then a little south to Mountain View, where Batya was staying, and then fly up to Seattle for a couple of days.</description>

It&#39;s great when a number of voices in the community have an open discussion but one of the things I found myself lamenting was the fact that a lot of the discussion isn&#39;t truly accessible. Why not?</description>

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; As a teacher, sometimes your gut tells you to do something and it turns out to be a really good idea. That&#39;s what happened in October, 1994. I decided to dress up as Groo the Wanderer for Halloween. I never dressed in costume for school before and back then, no many did. A few students and very few teachers. Afterwards, I noticed that my younger students - the ones that didn&#39;t know me that well yet, really loosened up and so a tradition was born.</description>

It&#39;s another bad idea that we refuse to let die. Eight years ago JonAlf joked that someone in class joked that they should have a party and they should all get dressed up. My thought? &#34;YEAH!!! LET&#39;S DO IT!!!!!&#34; Eight years later, still going strong. We cleaned out and decorated the room - classed things up by serving cheese, dried fruits, nuts and the like.</description>

Stuy 2004 also had their 10 year reunion last night. It&#39;s always nice to be invited to reunions - I know it&#39;s largely dependent on who&#39;s on the organizing committee but it&#39;s nice to be remembered. Last time I wrote about Stuy reunions I noted how similar they all are.</description>

Traditionally, math team coaches from around the city descend on Stuy for a day full of lectures, discussion, and general catching up. I&#39;ve never actually attended these meetings. In the past, they were for math team coaches only and this year, I was actually allowed to do something with the CS teachers.</description>

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; In a few hours Devorah and I will be off to our thirty year high school reunion. It&#39;s going to be a boat ride - reminiscent of those excursion day trips to Bear Mountain that Stuy had back in the day. Having taught CS at Stuy for the last twenty plus years, I&#39;ve also been invited to my share of reunions as a teacher. Sometimes the current crop ask me about the reunions and how they compare to mine.</description>

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; Yesterday, some of the seniors from the 301 crowd along with a few teachers had an end of year dinner at Joe&#39;s Shanghai. While it&#39;s Famous for its soup dumplings: I&#39;m partial to the braised pork shoulder: We haven&#39;t had a 301 dinner in a long time, but I remember the crew, first unnamed, then using the moniker &#34;the Z-team&#34; used to go their all them time. It was always Joe&#39;s Shanghai, followed by a trip to the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory: and then the obligatory photo in front of the Mei Dick Barbershop at 37 Mott St (now gone): The 301 crew, or Z-team as it&#39;s some times been called are the students that spend their time in the CS room at Stuy.</description>

      <title>What I love about StuyCS</title>

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; One of the things I love about StuyCS is that we&#39;ve built a true Geek culture. Last week, we had a last minute visitor - Stephen Wolfram. Well known for Mathematica and more importantly, Wolfram Alpha, without which our students wouldn&#39;t be able to complete all their homework. The only problem was that we had about 24 hours from when the visit was confirmed til the talk was to take place.</description>

      <description>I think my one regret over the years is that I haven&amp;rsquo;t done much travel. So, when I had the opportunity to go to the 2014 Tapia conference, I jumped at the chance. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see too much of Seattle, but that&amp;rsquo;s OK. Now I&amp;rsquo;ve more incentive to go back.
In addition to seeing new sites, it also gave me an opportunity to see friends that I don&amp;rsquo;t get to see too often.</description>

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; Today was Halloween. This year we were the crew of the Enterprise. The original series, that is. Overall, the school had a much more subdued spirit than past years but it was fun. Certainly more fun for me than the past couple of years. For those of you that don&#39;t know - I have a long history of going all out for Halloween. Starting in October 1994 as Groo the Wanderer: To Bob Ross: To many more.</description>

      <description>For those of that don&amp;rsquo;t know, the New York Tech Meetup it&amp;rsquo;s one of the things that help make the New York Tech Scene so awesome.
It&amp;rsquo;s a group of some 30k+ members and once a month, at Skriball Center at NYU they hold a meetup. It&amp;rsquo;s really quite an event. Members of the tech community demo their projects, there&amp;rsquo;s question and answer time, and afterwards theres a gathering for schmoozing amongst the crowd and the presenters.</description>

      <description>This past year, I was able to convince my administration to allow me to create a new course - Software Development. I really felt there was something missing in our kids CS preparation - missing both from Stuy&amp;rsquo;s program and from many youngsters college experiences.
I plan to do a few posts on the course, it&amp;rsquo;s design, implementation, and lessons learned, but for today, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the years culminating event:</description>

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; Inspired by the likes of Jon Simantov and David Lerner as well as the greater Stuy CS family, a few of us have been working on CSTUY, Computer Science and Technology for Urban Youth. Yeah, we backed into the acronym. Let&#39;s bring Stuy CS out of Stuy so we can work on inspiring a wider range of students. Well, last Wednesday we had our inaugural event. Hosted by NY TechStars (thanks Moisey), we invited 75 youngsters to an evening of talks.</description>

      <description>A little over a year ago, I decided it was time to reach out to my alums, a group I refer to as the &amp;ldquo;Stuy CS family&amp;rdquo; and try to get us together. The most rewarding part of my job involves the relationships I&amp;rsquo;ve developed over the years but is was always between me and my alums and them to their classmates. This was an attempt to start building a network that spanned the years.</description>

      <description>The day before Thanksgiving is always fun. For as long as I can remember, recent graduates descend upon Stuy. For the most part, they mull around the senior bar but we get our share up in 301.
This year was a little quiet but I got to see more than my share of graduates over the weekend as I attended the 2002 and 2007 class reunions. I&amp;rsquo;ve only been invited to a handful of reunions and really consider it an honor when I am.</description>

      <description>On going back to work today Since school was still out due to Sandy, we ran a second online class yesterday. At the end of the session, which I&amp;rsquo;ll summarize below, I told the class what I wanted them to accomplish today and over the weekend. One student queried &amp;ldquo;you mean no class on Friday :-(?&amp;rdquo; Alas no &amp;ndash; while students aren&amp;rsquo;t reporting to school this morning, teachers are.
Of course the logic as to why is far from sound.</description>
