      <description>A while ago I wrote about a small side project - GitHub Org Explorer - a small tool to make it easier to manager GitHub repositories based on organization. I&amp;#39;m using it as a replacement for the GitHub provided Classroom Assistant. I find it more flexible in terms of exporting assignments to my own machine and it allows me to delete repos en masse which is critical after the semester is over.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m a big fan of GitHub Classroom and use it for all of my class assignments. It&amp;#39;s great for organizing, distributing, and collecting assignments and gets the kids used to using real world tools at the same time. I&amp;#39;ve written a bunch of posts on how I use it:
How I use GitHub Classroom Communicating with Students - meybe GitHub to the rescue GitHub as a tool for education (part of a 4 part series) As well as a couple of others.</description>

      <description>Last week I talked about using GitHub issues as a mechanism for class communication. I thought it might be helpful to follow up on it and also felt that a video would be better than text.
So, here it is, 16 minutes on how you can use GitHub issues for class communication. I don&amp;#39;t show examples of everything like @ tagging but I think it shows some of the power of using GitHub and GitHub classroom beyond just a software repo and versioning.</description>

      <title>CSTA 2019 - Using GitHub as a CMS</title>

      <description>With ISTE ending, the next big event for CS treachers is the annual CSTA Conference. I first attended two years ago in Baltimore. Last year the conference, in Omaha was bigger and better in every way imaginable. I expect this year to be the best yet.
I don&amp;#39;t go to a lot of conferences so I don&amp;#39;t have much to compare CSTA with but I like the fact that it&amp;#39;s is about half the size of SIGCSE.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s been an amazingly unproductive weekend. Mostly because I&amp;#39;ve been sick with the flu. It sucks but since the rest of the family&amp;#39;s away anway at least I&amp;#39;m not making everyone miserable.
I did manage to stage my next couple of classes and figured that writing this post wouldn&amp;#39;t take too much energy since it&amp;#39;s mostly a video.
Earlier, I talked about using GitHub and TravicCI and this time around I show how I use GitHub classroom to set up, disseminate, and collect assignments.</description>

      <title>GitHub Helps Me Help Students</title>

      <description>Earlier today I was reminded why I love GitHub in support of my classes. One of my students posted a question about our current lab. They posted a synopsis of the problem along with the error message.
Since we&amp;#39;re all working on GitHub the student&amp;#39;s work was already up online Since I started using GitHub Classroom I was able to quickly navigate to the repo. This might have been enough but to really in to the students work I cloned the repo and went into Emacs.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been using GitHub with my classes since GitHub&amp;#39;s early days. Over time I&amp;#39;ve gotten my workflows down. I use a combination of shell scripts - many just written on the fly, GitHub organizations, and some naming conventions and protocols that have served me well. A few years ago, the GitHub Education team started GitHub Classroom. I looked at it at the time. It was pretty cool but I had my workflow so I didn&amp;#39;t adopt it.</description>

      <description>One of the things I&amp;#39;ve heard for years from former students - both those looking for jobs and those looking to hire is that colleges don&amp;#39;t really do a good job preparing students for careers in tech. Sure they teach the algorithms and the theory but ther are a lot of missing pieces, particularly on the practical end. I&amp;#39;m certainly not advocating turning CS programs into coding schools but there are many low cost opportunities to bring practical real world best practices in to the CS classroom.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Coding or Cheating</title>

      <description>I haven&amp;#39;t been teaching this past semester. That&amp;#39;s why I haven&amp;#39;t been writing much about lessons. I miss working with students but that will resume in the fall and this semester has allowed me to get a jump on new projects.
It&amp;#39;s also allowed me to look at some student issues from a bit of a distance.
One issue that keeps coming up is cheating.
Some of it, classroom cheating.</description>
