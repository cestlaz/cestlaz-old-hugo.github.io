      <description>With the school year starting I was originally planning on writing about my class rules.
Instead I think I&amp;#39;ll riff on Alfred Thompson&amp;#39;s post today titled Curriculum is Hard. I&amp;#39;m guessing I found curriculum design and development daunting decades ago but at this point in my career it&amp;#39;s something I enjoy. In any event, Alfred got me to thinking - when is a curriculum your own?
If you grab a curriculum complete with lesson plans, assignments; the whole kit and caboodle and you use it verbatim it&amp;#39;s clearly not your curriculum.</description>
