      <description>Monday&amp;#39;s the start of the Spring semester. Other than the 8:00am start I&amp;#39;m looking forward to it. My 8:00am class is the honors/lab component that goes with CS1. I taught it last semester and during each of the past two years at Hunter. My second class is the follow up - more OOP / C++, data structures and some algorithms.
The material is old hat. I&amp;#39;ve taught it in Java more times than I can count and also in C++ albeit many years ago.</description>
