      <description>Yesterday, Alfred Thompson posted on students knowing their development environments. Alfred&amp;#39;s post was inspired by a related post by Eugene Wallingford. Eugene&amp;#39;s post was about more than development environments and both his and Alfred&amp;#39;s posts are worth a read.
Being a tool wonk I thought I&amp;#39;d add my two cents.
I&amp;#39;ve always been a tool wonk. Use the right tool for the job and if you need to buy one, don&amp;#39;t cheap out - get the best value right tool.</description>

      <title>Some Professional Development Is Worthwhile</title>

      <description>No, I&amp;#39;m not walking back anything from my last post. I still think we have to stop using professional development as the primary means for preparing CS teachers but I wanted to take a minute to make it clear that while there&amp;#39;s plenty of lousy PD out there, there&amp;#39;s also plenty of good stuff.
For bad PD, it&amp;#39;s frequently mandated and frequently neither useful or relevant or even if its potentially relevant, but the time it becomes useful you don&amp;#39;t remember it.</description>

      <title>Why PD doesn&#39;t work for CS</title>

      <description>EDIT I was reminded that by referring to CS4All and what it&amp;#39;s doing in NYC people could read an implication that the many hard working educators are not doing a yeoman&amp;#39;s job and indeed they are. They&amp;#39;ve been doing the heavy lifting from day 1 to bring opportunities to students and I did not mean to impugn their work or efforts in any way.
I also want to mention that I know that there are many educators working in NY in CS who have been providing direct support for teachers outside of PD and this post is not about them and their good work.</description>

      <description>Last time I mentioned that there are many teachers teaching CS in NY that have no intention of earning the new certification and also don&amp;#39;t really know the subject. People might not want to here this but it&amp;#39;s true. I don&amp;#39;t blame the teachers for this since they&amp;#39;ve been repeatedly told that &amp;#34;CS is super easy&amp;#34; and that their PD training 100% makes them CS teachers and really prepares them.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been running Hunter&amp;#39;s teacher certification program now for three years. We started with our Advanced Certificate which allows currently working teachers to earn an additional cert in CS and soon a few masters students joined the pipeline.
In three years we&amp;#39;ve made great progress. Approximately 45 New York City teachers are either state certified to teach CS or are qualified to recieve the certification once they file with the state.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was the last day of classes for our current cohort. The rest of the week and maybe weekend will be all grading all the time and then I&amp;#39;ll try to tune out work for a couple of weeks to try to recharge the batteries. Since there are some ongoing Hunter administrative snafus I&amp;#39;m not all that optimistic on getting real down time but we&amp;#39;ll see.
So, how did it go?</description>

      <description>Nope, not 40 years old, I&amp;#39;m closer to pushing 55. I&amp;#39;m talking about the number of New York&amp;#39;s certified computer science teacher.
Two years ago, there weren&amp;#39;t any. Last year we got 21 and now, with the semester wrapping up we&amp;#39;ll get another 23. That&amp;#39;s 44 state certified computer science teachers in a hurry and what&amp;#39;s more, 44 teachers that I can comfortably say really know their stuff both in terms of CS content and how to teach it.</description>

      <description>My friend Tom tweeted earlier which led me to this piece on trends in CS professional development (PD). Tom&amp;#39;s tweet was talking about virtual vs in person PD so I initially thought I&amp;#39;d write about that and PD in general but the article actually led to some deeper issues with PD.
The article talks about PD being focussed on specific units or modules, narrowing to more popular offerings and also becoming less localized.</description>

      <description>You don&amp;#39;t become a master teacher overnight. It takes years, perhaps decades. Year one, you&amp;#39;re just trying to survive. Year two is frequently a small step back. Year three on is slow improvement provide the teacher works to improve. To me and eight to ten year teacher is usually an advanced beginner, fifteen years? Seasoned. Master teacher? You&amp;#39;re probably pushing close to 20 years or more. Of course, there are exceptions but this is the pattern I&amp;#39;ve most often observed (burnout notwithstanding).</description>

      <description>It took a while but we&amp;#39;re finally here. Hunter College is launching it&amp;#39;s Computer Science Teacher Certification programs. This was the second big initiative I&amp;#39;ve been working on at Hunter. The first was the Daedalus undergraduate CS scholars program. The Daedalus program started my first year and is now providing the best value (and in my opinion best) undergraduate CS opportunity in New York. CS Certification took longer. I had to design the programs, they had to make it through the whole CUNY governance process which even under ideal circumstances takes around a year and then up through NYSED.</description>

      <description>Presenting at CSTA 2020 I noticed a few tweets and posts from people announcing that they&amp;#39;d be presenting at CSTA2020 - the big computer science teachers conference held every July.
A common thread in a few of these were trepidation&amp;#39;s presenters. Excited to be doing this but nervous.
It&amp;#39;s interesting that teachers, myself included, sometimes get nervous before presentations even though we present every day as part of our jobs.</description>

      <description>Out of class student communication is always a challenge. There are plenty of options:
Piazza Facebook group Slack, Discord, or other chat system Discourse, Vanilla or other discussion forum system Mailing list but all have warts. I shared my thoughts on a number of these options a while ago but thought I&amp;#39;d update them now.
Most of my opinions hold form my earlier post. I was using and continue to use a mailing list as I can be pretty sure that students will get the email and they don&amp;#39;t have to go to any outside site or application.</description>

      <description>When I wrote about the HighWebEd I mentioned John William&amp;#39;&amp;#39;s talk on Agile. He spoke about how the movie Airplane! was filmed in an Agile manner and gave as an example the development of the &amp;#34;jive&amp;#34; scenes. &amp;lt;iframe width=&amp;#34;560&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;315&amp;#34; src=&amp;#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdCjbJ6NEfc&amp;#34; frameborder=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; allow=&amp;#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&amp;#34; allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;
Apparently the creative team had a script but it wasn&amp;#39;t working. The first pair that read for the role, Norman Gibbs and Al White had their owned take.</description>

      <title>Classes Or After school programs - which is more important for female retention in CS?</title>

      <description>This morning Mark Guzdial tweeted on his latest post:
Results from Longitudinal Study of Female Persistence in CS: AP CS matters, After-school programs and Internships do not https://t.co/GOzp3045Hp
&amp;mdash; Mark Guzdial (@guzdial) October 14, 2019 I&amp;#39;m glad Mark wrote about this as it&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s important to both research and publicize but it&amp;#39;s really not a surprise.
I&amp;#39;m going to start by dismissing the statement that &amp;#34;… participation in the Aspirations awards program were teh best predictors of persistence three years after the high school survey in both CS and other technology-related majors.</description>

      <description>Alfred Thompson posted today about cheating on CS class projects. It was in response to Garth Flint&amp;#39;s post on finding interesting projects which in turn referenced earlier posts by Alfred and me.
Garth laments that it&amp;#39;s hard to find projects that are both interesting and meaty but where solutions can&amp;#39;t easily be searched for online. Alfred notes that cheating will happen and that it&amp;#39;s an ethics issue. This is why I try to create a culture of sharing and acknowledging credit (that is, citing sources) but I&amp;#39;m not naive enough to believe there isn&amp;#39;t any cheating in my classes.</description>

      <description>There are things we do in school and there are things we do in industry and they&amp;#39;re not always the same. In school we might use a learning language or an IDE which gives additional support and at times even take away language features while at work you might you might make heavy use of continuous integration tools. On the other hand, sometimes we use the same things. Java is used in schools and in industry, StackOverflow consulted in both and many schools use professional IDEs like Eclipse.</description>

      <description>I recently did a unit where I had my students convert words into Pig Latin. I like the problem because to start it only requires strings, functions and if statements but there is some depth to the unit.
We start with simplified rules:
If the word starts with a vowel, add &amp;#34;ay&amp;#34; to the end of the word If it starts with a consonant move the first latter to the end and add &amp;#34;ay&amp;#34; don&amp;#39;t worry about anything else Students usually start with something like this:</description>

      <description>I recently took a look at the Cryptopals Crypto Challenges. It&amp;#39;s a series of challenges through which you can learn all about crypto and crypto attacks. They say they&amp;#39;ll eventually have solutions but since the site appears to be at least a few years old, who knows it they&amp;#39;ll ever publish them.
One interesting thing about the site is that it really doesn&amp;#39;t have a lot of content to teach you the concepts around the challenges.</description>

      <description>I was planning on writing up all the exciting CS Education work I got to be involved in these past two days but I saw a post on one of the CS discussion forums that got me riled. There&amp;#39;s a teacher (name withheld to protect the innocent) who wants to create an advanced course for his students but his administration is requesting an outside measure of accountability. This sounds reasonable on the surface but I found it really insulting.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m enjoying reading about Ria Galanos&amp;#39; new chapter on her blog. In her most recent post Ria briefly talks about the fact that very few professional developers start from scratch and most work in existing large code bases. She wonders why the College Board got rid of the APCS-A case study and talked about how it gave students an opportunity to work on a multi-file complex system. Over the past few years others have wondered if the College Board should bring it back.</description>

      <description>So, I got back from CSTA2019 and promptly got a summer cold which laid me up for the past couple of days.
Phoenix was beautiful even with it being unbearably hot at times and it&amp;#39;s a place I think I&amp;#39;d like to visit again when it&amp;#39;s a bit cooler. I said in an earlier post that for me, CSTA is typically more of a person conference and less of a session conference and that held true again.</description>

      <description>Looking forward to flying out to Phoenix for CSTA-2019 Saturday morning. The conference doesn&amp;#39;t officially start until Sunday, Monday for me since I&amp;#39;m not doing any of the pre-conference workshops. We&amp;#39;ll have most of Saturday as long as we&amp;#39;re up to it, Sunday, and Monday morning. Actually, there is the GitHub reception on Sunday evening so that&amp;#39;s kind of official conference stuff.
As to the conference, I&amp;#39;m super looking forward to it.</description>

      <description>Now that the semester&amp;#39;s over I&amp;#39;ve had a chance to reflect a bit on my teaching over the past year. This year I taught two classes each semester so the load was a little higher. First semester was one class of our CS0 and one of the lab/enrichment component that goes with CS1. Nothing big to report there as I&amp;#39;ve done them both before.
The biggest difference was that I had to deal with two separate classes even though they&amp;#39;re one cohort.</description>

      <description>Someone mentioned Grokking Algorithms by Aditya Y. Bhargava in one of the CS educator Facbeook groups. It looked interesting so I thought I&amp;#39;d give it a once over.
It&amp;#39;s certainly an accessible book. Text mixed with cute line drawings, &amp;#34;hand written&amp;#34; text, diagrams and picture.s It reminded me of one of my favorite, most accessible Calculus books Who Was Fourier.
Overall I enjoyed the book but I&amp;#39;m not sure what its best audience is.</description>

      <description>Reading Garth Flint&amp;#39;s end of year post and Alfred Thompson&amp;#39;s follow up had me thinking about a couple of things. One was spurred when Garth wrote &amp;#34;They also have to figure out the math before they code.&amp;#34; This made me think about all the details we sometimes take for for granted. Things that are hard for our students that we just know. It&amp;#39;s frequently math that we might find trivial but it could also be much simpler things.</description>

      <description>Just like last year, I&amp;#39;m taking in two classes worth of students in to my honors program. The challenge is that I can only teach two classes and I&amp;#39;ve got to figure out what to teach and then which students belong in which class.
It basically comes down to one of two courses, our CS0 (CSCI127) and our CS1 (CSCI135). CSCI127 is a first programming experience. The normal class is taught as a large lecture with small recitation/labs.</description>

      <description>Lat day of the 2019 NCWIT Summmit. Got up crazy early, got back from my run and saw this when I checked Twitter:
A1: CSTA, Twitter chats like this one, @guzdial and @alfredtwo&amp;#39;s blogs among others. In all cases because those places start from assuming I&amp;#39;m a CS teacher, rather than starting from assuming I&amp;#39;m a teacher who is better at teaching something else. #csk8 https://t.co/6DO77fzq0j

      <description>Now that high school seniors have all committed to their respective colleges I though I&amp;#39;d share some information on Hunter&amp;#39;s incoming Daedalus (honors CS) cohort.
I joke about the first cohort saying that nobody applied to the program. That&amp;#39;s kind of true. I jointed Hunter a little over three years ago in late January. That was after high school seniors had already applied to college and at that time the program didn&amp;#39;t exist.</description>

      <description>One of the things I mentioned in my post on the CS Educators StackExchange was the fragmentation of resources for CS Educators. My friend and fellow CS teacher Ben pointed out that this is appropriate as we&amp;#39;re so young as a community. He&amp;#39;s absolutely right but until we mature, discover-ability can be a problem. We all have our resources and I for one am frequently surprised when talking to a friend and discovering that they don&amp;#39;t know about a site or a mailing list that I&amp;#39;ve known about for years.</description>

      <description>The CS Educators StackExchange is now in public beta. For those of you who are not in tech, StackExchange is a network of question answering sites. StackOverflow is probably the most famous - many peoples go to site for computer science and programming questions and answers.
During this period of public beta the site will be working on defining itself and also on developing a critical mass of users. I hope the site succeeds and I encourage everyone to check it out, ask questions, answer some and let&amp;#39;s all see where this goes.</description>
