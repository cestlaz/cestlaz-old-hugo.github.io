      <description>A common refrain against requiring CS in our K12 schools is that we don&amp;#39;t have the teachers and we won&amp;#39;t any time soon. Sure, we don&amp;#39;t right now but we won&amp;#39;t if we don&amp;#39;t do something about it.
The question to ask is &amp;#34;how long will it take&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;how do we get there?&amp;#34;
Let&amp;#39;s look at New York City. We&amp;#39;ve got approximately 1,000,000 students in our public schools. Let&amp;#39;s say that&amp;#39;s grades 1 to 12.</description>

      <description>I wanted to give a little more context on yesterday&amp;#39;s post. In reading over the various comments on social media related to the topic of required and desired CS teacher knowledge there are those that fall on the content is king and pedagogy not so important and others who think you don&amp;#39;t really need a deep knowledge of CS. I think you need both and think current teachers need to be given a reasonable but finite amount of time to get there.</description>
