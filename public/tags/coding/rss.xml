      <description>It&amp;#39;s almost December which means it&amp;#39;s almost time for Advent of Code 2019. Advent of code is an annual computer programming competition created and ruyn by Eric Wastl. It&amp;#39;s been running since 2015. I&amp;#39;ve written about it before, mostly from a teacher&amp;#39;s point of view (Solve A to Solve B, Data structures and Hidden Complexity, Tools can shape how we think and a few others). Basically, Eric releases one poblem a day at midnight from Dec 1 through Dec 25.</description>

      <description>What can I do to discourage my students from using the &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; statement?
That was more or less the gist of the comment and it elicited some good responses. This time the conversation was on Facebook but I&amp;#39;ve seen this one and participated in it many times before. I never liked the question when presented as a &amp;#34;how can I stop them&amp;#34; one. I equally dislike when the offered advice is basically &amp;#34;never use break no matter what&amp;#34; or something similar.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;#39;s Advent of Code problem was a variant on the Josephus problem.
I recalled that there was a formula to figure out the sole survivor but I decide to run a simulation rather than looking it up. I also decided to write it up in C++, well, really C with cout instead of printf.
Part 1 was the traditional problem. Part 2 was a variant where at each iteration, you remove the elf opposite the elf being processed (see the problem description for details).</description>
