      <title>User friendly - I do not think that means what you think it means</title>

      <description>Saw this post the other day: Emacs is hurting Clojure and this response: Is Emacs Really HJard to Learn / Use.
This called to mind those countless discussions about tools being user friendly. I&amp;#39;m frequently on the unpopular side of these discussions. Linux vs Windows vs Mac, Shell vs GUI, Emacs vs fill-in-the-blank-editor-or-IDE and on and on.
Don&amp;#39;t use Emacs, it isn&amp;#39;t user friendly. Don&amp;#39;t use Linux, it isn&amp;#39;t user friendly.</description>

      <description>Quick post to add to the recent command line fu I&amp;#39;ve been writing about.
Douglas Peterson had another Whatever happened to post. This time on Logo. I wanted to reply, talk about NetLogo and link to some of my old NetLogo posts to help show how cool it is.
Nikola supports tags, makes a nice tags page and for each tag, a nice page of all the links.
Nikola has a plugin tags which lets you manage tags from the command line.</description>

      <title>BASH scripting?</title>

      <description>Over in the Facebook AP Computer Science Teachers group someone asked for thoughts on covering BASH scripting as a post AP topic.
A number of us made suggestions. I linked to this old blog post.
One group member said she asked around for similar suggestions and the response she got was &amp;#34;vi and awk.&amp;#34; I wanted to jokingly respond &amp;#34;and after they suggested that they got into their time machine and went back to the 70&amp;#39;s.</description>

      <description>Repost This is a repost from March 2015. It didn&amp;#39;t transfer when I rebooted the blog.
Original Quick post on why I love the Unix command line.
We&amp;#39;re busy organizing CSTUY&amp;#39;s first hackathon. It&amp;#39;s going to be at SumAll, where we hold our weekly hacking sessions but while taking registration, we had a little program.
The kids signed up on a Google doc but we all know the story â€“ when people sign up for a free event, even one with free food and t-shirts, many don&amp;#39;t show.</description>

      <title>Should We Teach HTML?</title>

      <description>Yesterday, Doug Peterson wrote a &amp;#34;Whatever happened to&amp;#34; post subtitled HTML as an essential 21st Century skill? It&amp;#39;s a nice post.
I left a comment but thought I&amp;#39;d elaborate here.
No, knowing HTML is not programming - it&amp;#39;s markup. Even so, when I help people design CS programs, I&amp;#39;ll frequently recommend starting with HTML or at least introducing it early.
Why?
It&amp;#39;s a gateway and not just to programming.</description>

      <title>Spreadsheet? I&#39;d rather use the command line.</title>

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; Spreadsheets are terrific - we&#39;ve all used them. I particularly like Google spreadsheets - I use them all the time to collect data, usually from students. Go to Google Drive Make a form Send the form out to the students Wait All the data gets dumped into a Google spreadsheet. The trouble is, what to do with it once it&#39;s in the spreadsheet. The other day, I wrote on a few basic stats for our upcoming SHIP program.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, I noticed this Twitter conversation between Alfred Thompson and Steve Keinath
I briefly considered proposing a session for the conference but it was just a day or two before the deadline, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;m going to be able to attend the conference, and besides, who said anything I proposed would be accepted.
Still, I liked the idea - I&amp;rsquo;ve been an educator for 23 years, a Linux user for most of that time and an Unix user for longer.</description>

      <description>I tell my students &amp;ldquo;the cool thing about what we do is that if we&amp;rsquo;re not happy with the way something works, we&amp;rsquo;ve got a shot at fixing it.&amp;rdquo;
That came up this morning so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share.
I recently posted about the in-term projects my Software Development kids were working on. Well, now it&amp;rsquo;s time to grade their final projects.
The code is up on GitHub. This morning I was faced with independently going to every project page and cloning each one:</description>
