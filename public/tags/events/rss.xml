      <description>Today&amp;#39;s the last day of spring break. After the weekend it&amp;#39;s back to the grind. It really hasn&amp;#39;t been much of a spring break. The rain and the snow made for very little spring and between working on the Hunter / CUNY2X Internship program and reviewing applications for my Hunter Daedalus CS Honors program there has been very little break.
Today was no exception - I spent much of the day working but I did take a few hours to head over to Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island.</description>
