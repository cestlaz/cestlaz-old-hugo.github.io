      <description>I spent the last couple of days attending Personal Democracy Forum 2016, described on their landing site as:
The worldâ€™s leading conference exploring and analyzing technology&amp;#39;s impact on politics, government, and society.
That&amp;#39;s the reason why I haven&amp;#39;t posted my latest Emacs video.
PDF is a great conference and raised a huge number of important issues. I&amp;#39;ll probably blog about a few over the next few weeks.
One topic that I&amp;#39;ve already lamented about has been the way we as a society are allowing so much information to be silo-ed in platforms like Facebook.</description>
