As he usually does (and of which I'm always appreciative) JCS [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12701][shared]]
my most recent Emacs post in which I go over a small Elisp routine
that I wrote.

JCS commented that he liked that I don't post process or edit my
videos. I work through whatever I'm doing and if I make a mistake, so
be it, I'll try to figure it out live. I do things this way partly
because of laziness but also because I think the result is more
authentic. People doing something similar on their own will likely
make mistakes and if every video and resource they find online is
perfect, it creates an unrealistic expectation.

It's like how the usual self reporting of AP scores in the CS
communitie unfolded a bunch of times with the only people sharing
their results were teachers who's students all did well. Given
national scores, we know that not every student gets a great AP score
but it created an unrealistic and demotivating picture for teachers in
the community who's results were more, let's say mixed.

From very early on, I've been pretty comfortable making mistakes in
front of my classes. I mean, once I got to Stuy, I regularly taught
students much smarter than I was. I almost always knew more material
but they could stump me at times and once they dove into the mathy
side, I was way out of my league. I felt being honest and open was my
best approach and making mistakes allowed me to model that mistakes
are part of the process as well as how to proceed. Of course a
challenge would be recreating the mistake that was organic in period
two later in the day.

Anyway, since I think my willingness to make mistakes in front of my
students - my honesty in that regard is part of what made me a strong
teacher, JCS's comment made me think of Alfred Thompsons recent
excellent [[https://blog.acthompson.net/2024/12/three-keys-to-being-great-teacher.html][post]] on what turns a good teacher into a great teacher. 

Alfred focused on three things:

 - Relationships with students - they care about their students as people.
 - They had to be enthusiastic about the subject they teach.
 - They had to innovate - that is develop their classes over time.

It's a good list. Many great teachers do indeed have these there
qualities. I think it's worth considering though that while these are
generally positive teacher attributes, they're not absolutes.

I've met some great teachers and teachers who have been considered to
be great who don't have these qualities.

While none of the great teachers I know have disdain for their
students, some don't have any real relationship with them and they
don't really care about their success outside of them wanting all
their students to pass their class.

Now, I've built my career on relationships so I never built a wall
between me and my students and I don't understand teachers that do but
I do have to recognize that building relationships isn't an absolute
for one to be a great teacher.

Same with subject enthusiasm. Sure, it probably helps, but again, I've
met some great teachers who are more or less indifferent. What's
important is that they have sufficient subject knowledge and it
probably helps if they also do care about their students so maybe you
need at least one from column A and one from column B.

Finally, innovation. I always worked to improve and refine my work and
would probably have gone crazy teaching the same thing in the same way
for three plus decades but again, I've seen some great teachers who do
the same thing pretty much the same way year in and year out.

On the flip side, I've seen some lousy teachers who have all three
of these great teacher qualities. They care, they know their stuff and
love their subject area, and try new things but they're just not
particularly good.

JCS's post made me think about this because for me, open honesty was
helpful in being my strongest teacher self, whatever that was and
is. I also listened the other day to the most recent CSEd Podcast
which had a professor sharing a particular practice he uses in
class. I'm also planning to write a post on that but it also made
think on how a teachers pedagogical toolbox can also have an affect
on how "great" a teacher one is.

I guess the moral of the story is that while we can pick out some
common attributes that many great teachers share, great teaching is
hard to pin down which is why it's so hard to meaningfully evaluate
teachers. I guess it's like Justice Potter Stewart's concurring
opinion on identifying "hard-core" pornography. We might not be able
to define it but we know it when we see it.
