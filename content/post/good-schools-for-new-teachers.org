Usually, when I write about a teacher get together it's either my
StuyCS people or CS educators. Last week, it was another group. Each
year, Devorah, along with a bunch of her former colleagues from the
Manhattan Center for Science and Math (MCSM) get together for a year
end celebration. They've been doing this for something like 20 years
even though most of the crew is retired now and all but I think one or
two have left MCSM. For the most part, they all started close to the
same time and most were in the Science department. I've joined in from
time to time and they usually get a good crowd of between one to two
dozen teachers. Last year, the gathering focused on Devorah's
retirement and this year on another from the crew. 

To be honest, I'm a little jealous. sure, we used to have periodic end
of term lunches at Stuy but to keep a group together even after so
many have left the fold is pretty cool.

David, a terrific Physics teacher in the group (and presumably the retiring
honoree next year) made a comment, noting that so many of the group
started at around the same time. He said that they were really lucky
because MCSM was a really good school for new teachers. He commented
on how much support he got across the board and how his colleagues,
supervisors, and administrators really helped him and others grow.

This got me thinking. My first few years of teaching were at Seward
Park High School - actually, a school with some similarities to
MCSM. Both were large schools. Not giant monsters like Stuy or
Brooklyn Tech but still pretty large. Both also had a range of
students in terms of ethnicity as well as academic performance. In
those early days I had classes with kids on parole, drug dealers, and
thugs and I also had classes with the nicest kids you'd ever met. I
had kids who in 10th grade or beyond could barely add and I had super
high achieving honors students. All that and everything in between.

The biggest difference between MCSM and Seward Park is that at Seward most of
the faculty were at war with the administration.

I've been told often that "bad" schools - rough students and/or
horrid administrations frequently result in very close knit faculties
and that seemed to be true at Seward. They all banded together and as
a newbie, they took me under their wings. Now, I personally had no
problems with the administration - I got along very well with my
direct supervisor and he loved me but I still was adopted by so many
others. New teachers frequently get the worst program but my chairman
had a different approach - he rotated everybody - he worked to give
me - the new kid - some tough classes and some easier ones and worked
to get me through the entire math sequence quickly. As to the
faculty - they helped me with lessons, sat in on my class, and let me sit
in with them. They also saved me with discipline issues. I had one
particularly rough class and a colleague with nonchalantly wander in
to use a computer in the back of the room. He came in because he knew
his presence would help with the discipline. The kids settled down and
were non the wiser. Mike (his name as well), would then on a day to
day basis work with me between classes until I could handle things on
my own.

Without the support of teachers like Mike, as well as a handful of
others, I would never have made it to year two let alone a three plus
decade career. Very little of this support I got was official but it
was critical in my staying in and succeeding as a teacher. 

Now, MCSM didn't have a dysfunctional administration. In fact, from
what I saw, they were pretty good. It wasn't until three principals
later that they got their disaster, which ultimately prompted a
handful of retirements and many transfers so might be fairly unique
that Dave, Devorah, and all of them had a school with both a good
administration and a united faculty, or at least science department
that really fostered the development of new teachers.

I think something that also helped both at Seward for me and MCSM was
the size of the school. Being large schools, there were always
multiple teachers for each subject. That meant a new teacher was never
on an island. It also meant that there were many other teachers to
observe, learn from, and get support from. It also meant that there
was never just one or two of the more desirable classes so while new
teachers might have gotten less desirable programs, they didn't get
the worst of the worst.

Contrast those two schools with Stuyvesant when I started. Stuy was
also a large school - in fact much larger, with few discipline
problems. I'd say that Stuy, back then, was much worse in terms of new teacher
development. Sure, teachers were nice enough - I became friends with a
number of them, but truth be told the most you'd get would be 
some notes from a previous semester or you could quietly sit in on
class. At Seward, I got that, plus debriefings but check ins and
more. At Stuy, I got the least desirable classes until I took over CS
(although even the worst classes at Stuy were pretty desirable) as
well as the worst rooming situation - I was running from the third
floor to the 7th and back between three periods early on. At Seward,
my program was pretty much the same as everyone else. 
I'd like to hope I helped foster a better environment as the CS
program grew and we brought in new teachers but I can't say.

Another problem with Stuy, at least for new teachers, and this is
probably true at many high performing schools, both public and
private, is that new teachers don't really have to learn how to
teach. They can be bad at their craft and the students will still pass
the standardized exams. I've seen new teachers at stuy who never
taught elsewhere who thought they were great but really weren't - at
best they got by on the fact that they were young and had some
charisma. Their kids did alright but deserved better. Some were self
aware enough to figure it out but by and large it was an issue. Of
course at a tough school the new teacher would just leave the
profession while at the high performing school, the teacher in
question might go on to a career of just not teaching that well.

In a profession with an extremely high attrition rate and also one
where much preservice preparation is, let's say, limited, we have to
do better. Obviously the biggest issues are things like class size,
pay, and benefits but starting out at a school that's friendly to new
teachers can be the difference maker.
