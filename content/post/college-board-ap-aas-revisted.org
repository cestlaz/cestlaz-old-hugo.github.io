I woke up this morning and as usual, looked over recent postings on
Diane Ravitch's blog. For those of you who don't know, Diane is an
education historian and a staunch advocate for public schools. She's
been outspoken against charters, vouchers, and other privatization
efforts. What adds to Diane's credibility is that she came over from
the other side as she was assistant secretary of education under George
H.W. Bush and originally a charter supporter until she saw through the
lies.

Anyway, I read [[https://dianeravitch.net/2023/04/24/college-board-announces-plan-to-revise-african-american-ap-course-again/][this]] post on how the College Board is now planning on
revising AP African American Studies again. As you may recall, a few
months ago the College Board decided to accede to the demands of
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and water down their APCS African
American Studies (AAS) exam by removing (as reported by actual AAS
scholars, legitimate important history). I shared my thoughts [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/college-board-ap-aastudies/][here]].

Now, it seems that they're reconsidering.

I've long said that the CS Education community has been far too
accepting of the College Board. The bottom line is that the college
board has always looked out for one thing, their bottom line. CS was
a new subject area to exploit.

Is this re-examination of APAAS a realization that acceding to
DeSantis was wrong? Doubtful. More likely this is concern over losing
money from the rest of their customers.

Will APAAS go back to what it was originally slated to be before the
DeSantis cuts? I don't know. I wouldn't be surprised if the college
board tries to roll out two APAAS classes hoping to capture both
markets. They can have AP-AAS-R (for Red State, Republican, or Racist, take
your pick) with the DeSantis seal of approval and AP-AAS since that
one would presumably just be couched in history and the subject matter
as directed by recognized AAS scholars. If they go that route, we
shouldn't let them off the hook.

It's long been obvious to those of us paying attention that the
college board is about money and control, not education. It's time for
the rest of the education community to start paying attention as well.
