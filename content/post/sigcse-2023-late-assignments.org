The first "good idea at the time" dealt with deadline extensions. 

The scenario in question was presented by my long time friend Lauren
Bricker of the University of Washington although a very similar
situation was also presented by of Kristin Stephens-Martinez of
Duke. Lauren was one of the few High School teachers with a strong
background in CS so she's really a unicorn and it made sense for UW
to come calling and snatch her up.

The issue was students turning in projects late. This is a tale as old
as time. Deadlines are a hot button issue in education. Some think
that we need hard ones and others think you should be able to turn
anything in at any time. I fall somewhere in between.

In Lauren's case far too many students were asking for
extensions. This was a problem. The first solution was to allow any
student to request a 2 week extension on any in term project. You
couldn't ask for an extension on the final project. With the
extension, a student could resubmit one time.

This worked well with some students - students who had something going
on during the project run or otherwise had legitimate issues that made
the original project window unrealistic.

The problem was that too many students would use the policy to
basically not do anything until the last minute - essentially treat
the project as a project with a deadline two weeks further out.

So, this policy worked for the student who tried to do things the
right way but would end up with others getting jammed up and falling
further and further behind as the class moved on.

One suggested solution would be to require specific milestones be
submitted but this would likely be a hardship on the students who
legitimately needed the extra time.

My suggestion was as follows.

I noticed that  Lauren uses git with her classes. Git has a wonderful
feature - extensive logs. As long as a student commits and pushes
their work to whatever central repository system they use - GitLab,
GitHub or other, the instructor can easily see what was done when.

My policy has always been that as long as you've been doing some level
of legitamate work on a project I'll give an extension. When I do
grant an extension I always start by asking the student - when do you
think is a reasonable due date and I also ask about any resources they
need. As long as the their suggestion is reasonable I go with it. If
it isn't, we discuss why it isn't and come up with something together.

What do I mean by legitamate work? Well, that depends but at a very
basic level, I look to see if there was some development of the
project, some code, working or failed or even documentation in the
readme about a student's issues (we set that policy of using the
readme as such early in the semester).

If a student asks for an extension but didn't commit/push anything, we
have a discussion. I may or may not grant the extension but you can
bet the next time they do it right.

The nice thing about this solution is that aspects can also be
automated. It's easy enough to write a script to determine how many,
if any commits a student has pushed in a given time frame. It would be
equaly easy to write a script to email students or instructors if a
student wasn't submitting anything within a certain time frame.

For my policy, beyond this, I just request that the student asks for
the extension prior to right before an assignment is due. Some
teachers disagree and feel that requiring a student ask is more than
what should be expected but I do think that there is a point where a
student has to advocate for themselves and I'll usually accept the
first last minute request but then not future ones.

So, that's how I've been dealing with late projects and it's worked
well for me and my classes. I hope it can be helpful to some of you
out there but if you've got another policy or method of trying to get
students to work on  their peojcts in a timely manner please share.
