After Paris, we spent a few days in Belgium. We have a friend there -
Helen, who teaches at the International School. Helen and Devorah
taught together at the Manhattan Center for Science and Math back in
the day and while I got to see Helen on my last visit here with Batya
last year, Devorah hasn't seen her for almost a decade.

This was more of a visiting part of our trip than a run around like
chickens without heads touring part but we still got in some good
stuff.

Helen lives in the Laeken suberb of Brussels so we spent time just
wandering there.

Had dinner at the Atomium - built for the 1958 world's fair. The top
sphere houses a restaurant while the others have various exhibits.

The restaurant's way up to so we got some cool views. Not at dinner
mind you - we were on the upper level of the top sphere which doesn't
have views but we were able to go down to the level with windows and
walk around.

The meal was tasty but the restaurant was uncomfortably warm and
apparently half the waitstaff called in sick so service wasn't
great. There was only one guy handling our entire level and he was
running around frantically all evening trying to keep up. Felt bad for him.x

We did also, though go to the inner city and do a walking tour.

Next day we explored Anderlecht, another essentially, borough of
Brussels. We went to see the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beguinage][Beguinage]] there. Basically a housing
complex for lay religious women.

The Beguinage was closed but we did get to a library that was
exhibiting a local artist's watercolor work and Devorah found a fabric
store.

The highlight was the Erasmus house. Completed in 1515, Desiderius
Erasmus Roterodamus, or Erasmus of Rotterdam lived there briefly and
the building is now a museum dedicated to his work. Really interesting
stuff.

Final day in Belgium was a visit to Brugges.

The reason for the visit was to see the lace center.

Devorah used to make lace - mostly bobbin lace before we had kids but
lace making and small children do not mix so she stopped. Now with the
kids grown she plans to start again and add to her set of hobbies -
sewing, knitting, spinning, and weaving. She's wanted to check out the
lace center for years.

Very cool place and far enough outside the touristy areas so that we
got a feel for the real town.

Of course, we also did the tour and played tourist as well.

As a bonus, on the tour we went in to the Brugges Beguinage so we got
to learn a bit more about that and them.

Between the tour and the lace center we also sat down for waffles.

Savory for lunch and sweet for dessert but the latter vanished before
we got pictures.

This was the more relaxed part of our trip - more visiting than
touring but still got to see the sights.

We're off to Antwerp today to finish out Belgium and then to the
Netherlands.
