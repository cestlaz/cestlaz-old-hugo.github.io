Long day two at SIGCSE lots of interesting stuff. Don't have the time
or energy to write anything up so I thought I'd share a list of
topics that I plan to write up in the next few days or weeks.

After day 1's keynote and the session on the ACM's 2023 curriculum I
went to "It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time" which is my new
favorite session replacing "Nifty Assignments." I plan to write up
that session over a couple of posts. I also went to the session on CS1
Pedagogical innovations and will write up some of what went on their.

Today's keynote was enjoyable but not too much to write about so I'll
skip that but there are a few things I want to talk about from the
"computing and liberal arts" session as well as from the
"microteaching" session. I also sat in on a session about student
success in CS2 but I might skip writing that up.

So, that's whats to come on this blog plus whatever's interestding
tomorrow.

So, stay tuned.
