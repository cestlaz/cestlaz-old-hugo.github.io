Before heading off to the Netherlands we had one more day in
Belgium. In Antwerp Specifically.

We stayed one night right across from the railway station which is
particularly magnificent.

First stop, the Plantin Moretus Museum. This museum focuses on two
16th century printers - Christophe Plantin and Jan Moretus. The
museum, which is  based in their homes and printing business covers
the history of the family, the evolution of their printing business
and the industry in general as well as the development of
technology. It also focused on some of their primary industries -
religious texts, science, and maps. Really amazing place.

After lunch we visited the Red Star Line museum.

This  was basically an immigrant experience museum. We've gone to tons
of these in the states but it was pretty interesting to see learn
about the story from the other side of the Atlantic where so many of
the journeys originated.

The next morning we were off to Rotterdam.

We spent the morning at hte Boijmans art depot. They store thousands
of works of art and many are on display but there are no descriptive
plaques or anything, just the art.

In one room we saw master after master - Money, Van Gogh, Bosch,
Rembrant and so many more one after another.  Also, tons of more
modern works.

A really amazing place.

Between the two we got lunch in their Markthal - a neat food hall set
up with an archaeological exhibit. A couple of blocks away outside
they also had an urban surfing pool.

Next was Leiden which was mostly a Devorah day.

We did hit the Windmill museum which was pretty cool. We got to climb
up a working windmill, learn about it and also the local history.

We also hit a number of fabric and textile places starting with the
Textile Research Center where they had an exhibit Shisha embroidery
and also showed us a bit of their archives in the back

We also hit the Weaver House - a house from the 1500s still
preserved. It housed poor families - mostly weavers throughout its
history. The walls had a list of all the inhabitants. 

We learned of the house's history and saw weaving demo. One of the
docent's recommended we then visit the headquarters of the Leidse
Deken - a group working on raising awareness of the history of
Leiden's artisinal blanket making industry as well as bringing it
back. We wandered in, went up the stairs, and introduced ourselves. We
got the grand tour.

They told us about their mission, how they created the blankets from
shorn sheep to end product and showed us around. Lots of cool looms,
spinning wheels, and even a weaving machine that was pedal powered.

Our one additional stop was at the American Pilgrims Museum which was
interesting. It was actually a split house museum  a house that has
been preserved through the ages. Half was as it was in the thirteen
hundreds and the other half, in the sixteen and seventeen
hundreds. There wasn't any evidence that any Pilgrims that would later
sail to America actually lived there but the house was typical of the
period when the Pilgrims were living in Leiden en route to America.

Overall a very interesting day.

We finished things off with an Indonesian meal. Tomorrow we're off to
Amsterdam for the last leg of our trip.
