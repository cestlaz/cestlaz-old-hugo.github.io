Heading to Amsterdam this morning and we'll be here until mid next week.

We spent yesterday in Antwerp but for a while we didn't know if we
were going to get there. Unbeknownst to us when we planned our trip,
yesterday was the season's first general strike in Belgium. When we
found out in Antwerp we weren't sure we'd be able to get out of the
city at all but it turned out that while the local trains would be out
the intercity ones were going business as usual. Since we couldn't get
to the required train station easily our host Helen drove us be she
had to do so before work. This meant that we arrived in Antwerp at
around 8:00am. Not a big deal. It was too early to check into our
hotel but we were able to leave our heavier bags and set out for
breakfast and a day of exploring.

To start, even before that, we came in to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerpen-Centraal_railway_station][Antwerp Central Station]].

It's really amazing. The original station goes back to the mid 19th
century with the current one replacing it around 50 years later. The
facade and entry are gorgeous but going back to the track area is
equally amazing. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerpen-Centraal_railway_station][Wikipedia page]] has more and better images so
check them out.

There was also this elevator status wall noting the levels:

Gotta love the zero indexing of the floors.

After breakfast we wandered around

and among other things found this, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brabo_Fountain][Brabo Fountain]] in front of city
hall.

Very cool. We also passed the cathedral seen in the background.

On the side, we saw these builders

and realized why cathedrals, including our local St. John's the
Unfinished take so long - the builders are made of bronze and don't
move!!!!!

This was on our way to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Het_Steen][Het Steen]] castle.

It had an old school instagram frame:

Inside was "The Antwerp Story" which had a nice overview of the city
and you could climb to the top as well. 

From there we tried to go to the [[https://museumplantinmoretus.be/en/content/welcome-museum-plantin-moretus][Plantin Moretus]] museum but were
thwarted - it was closed due to the strike.

From there it was to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp_Zoo][Antwerp Zoo]] - the oldest zoo in the
country. It was right next to the train station and just 10 minutes
from our hotel.

We saw lots of animals including this meerkat just standing there.

He was just standing there on his hind too legs you know, like that
guy - you know the one who sands - Rory Calhoun.

And also elephants:

And many more. There was also a nice little aquarium building where we
found dory:

After all of that we went back to the Hotel but they still didn't have
our room so we wandered some more - by the Ruben's house which is
closed for renovations and over to a local park. Then back to the
Hotel where they screwed up our room but we did finally get it
partially resolved - at least so that we had a roof over our head for
the night.

We finished off the day with a pretty awesome Ethiopian meal.

This morning we got some more chocolate for the road and are now on
the train to Amsterdam where we'll spend the next five days.
