Now that I'm back from my trip (and the subsequent cold that I've
battled for the past few days), time to get back to "work."


About a month ago, my friend [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonmarkgo/][Jonathan Gottfied]] interviewed me for his
[[https://deveducation.fm/e/r8krr96n-mike-zamansky][State of Developer Education]] podcast. It's an hour plus dive into CS /
Tech education. It dropped when I was on the plane back to NY last
Thursday. I meant to write this on Friday but my cold took me out
until today.

It was a thrill to be asked and fun to do - as you know, I love
talking shop. I've known the host, Jon, for years, I think we met when
he was at Twilio. For the past almost decade though, Jon has been
building [[https://mlh.io/][Major League Hacking]] - *the* organization to support
college hackathons. While I'm not  sold on the 30+ hours straight
format, a hackathon can be great tech extracurricular and MLH has done
so much to add structure and support for them. One of the things I
love about hackathons is that they're tech education adjacent and can
fill in missing pieces for students - networking with others, a social
activity, project creation, and outside personal learning. All great
things. Running an organization like MLH can also give people like Jon
a valuable "outsiders" view of what's coming out of the classroom. To
clarify, I say outsider to mean someone not employed as a teacher or
instructor. 


As to the episode of the podcast I was on, you can check it out here:

For teachers who read this blog, I'd recommend checking out the
podcast series in general. I've listened to a bunch and found them
both interesting and valuable. Most of the episodes I've listened to
are of professionals in the devrel space. Some come from traditional
CS backgrounds, some don't. As teachers, we can learn from their
perspectives and also gain insights into the professional tech
world beyond just being a traditional software engineer.

So, I'd encourage you all to check out the series here:

Enjoy.
