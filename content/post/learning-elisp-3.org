Here's another short video - this one on declaring functions in elisp.

Not much to say about it. It's similar to other languages.

In Python or C++ you might have:
#+begin_src
  # Python 
  def add2(a, b):
    return a+b

  // C++
  int add2(int a, int b){
    return a+b;
  }
#+end_src

Elisp is similar:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun add2 (a b)
    (+ a b))

#+end_src

But it's a little more "mathy." You've got the special form *defun*,
then the name of the function, parameters in parens and then the
body - all wrapped in parentheses. Note that you don't explicitly
write return. It's mroe like a mathematical expression where it
returns what the function evaluates to.

The video also describes the ~(interactive)~ form. By using it, we can
call our function as a command and bind a key combination to call it.

I do want to share one quick note on the content though - in the video
I write ~(dotimes (i 5) (next-line))~ to move down 5 lines. Instead of
using ~dotimes~ I could have just given a parameter to ~next-line~ -
that is, wrote ~(next-line 5)~. I chose to use dotimes in order to
introduce some control code. I wanted newbies to see it here before we
revisit control structuers more in depth in later videos.

Speaking of later videos, here's whats to come, maybe in a different
order.

- A video, probably with some internet lore and history on writing
  arot13 function which is a special case of a Caesar cipher.
- One on creating a function to make a consistent function header
- How to create a mode so that when you type an emoji in :'s you get
  the emoji. So, by typing :elephant: you'd see this: üêò.
- A function to use an API to replace a word with a synonym.
- And maybe a few more along the way.

For now, enjoy this short intro to writing functions:
