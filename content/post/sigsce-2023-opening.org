Arrived in Toronto yesterday for SIGCSE 2023 along with Devorah and
 Batya. Devorah to play tourist and Batya as conference attendee. As usual, I arrived
early the day befoer to get my bearings. Since we weren't partaking in
 any of the preconference activities we had an afternoon to explore
 the city. Ten miles walking from the hotel near the CN Tower, through
 and all around Kensington, looping through the University of Toronto
 campus and back. We local arts, games, yarn and fabric  shops as well as
 other local establishments.

 This morning, I have to say that the intro announcements was for the
 birds, or more specifically, the bird as there was a pigeon soaring
 up and all around the plenary hall.

 More seriously we had the usual warm welcome and I have to
 acknowledge that I really appreacited that like last year, coffee was
 available before the first session, Interesting that they
 announced around 1500 total participants which included both in
 person and remote. This is still down from in person attendance prior
 to Covid. Interpret that as you will.

 After the usual announcements - logistics, policies, top papers etc,
 we were off to the first keynote - atronaut Robert Thirsk. I really
 enjoyed his talk but it was an interesting choice as he's neither an
 educator or commputer scientists.

 Thirsk was a mission engineer on the space shuttle and he walked us
 through a mission. He artistically painted a picture of the
 environment, launch and all that it entailed. As the mission
 proceeded, he recounted how they dealt with systems failure after
 failure. Some legit, some sensor issues, some major, some minor. In
 the end they had to abort and make a danger fraught landing. From
 Florida to Spain in 40 minutes.

 Then the reveal - it was all a dream. Or rather a simulation.

 Then Thirsk proceeded with his takeawys and how he felt they related
 to education.

 First, a couple of things I noted about this mission:

 One, and this was something repeatedly emphasized by Thirst was that
 in order for the space shuttle to work over a million components have
 to work, interact, and work together both the first time and
 everytime and there has to be extreme redundency.

 Another was that the crew used notepads for their checklists and for
 important information. Here they are in one of the worlds most
 advanced technological creations. Surrounded by monitors, switches,
 indicators and the best technology can provide and they were using
 old school, hand held, hand written notebooks. Cool.

 After the mission, Thirsk talked about his takeaways. His big one was
 simulation modelling and experiential learning and doing  it so much
 that not only will you get it right but you can't get it wrong.

 Thirsk felt that we need much more of this and if our populations
 were trained this way maybe we woould have had better responses in
 times of crisis like when Covid hit or the supply chains failed.

 We already see a push for experiential learning in CS so I think most
 of us would agree but while his pleas were probably preaching to the
 choir this morning, it will probably fall on the deaf ears of those
 who actually make decisions and set policy.

 First off, simulation modelling and experiential learning takes
 longer and, like most teaching, works better in small classes. You
 know, likein those schools that rich folk send their kids to. Not so
 much in the public schools. It's also much easier to test
 memorization with standardized tests so I wouldn't hold my breath.

 Also, our entire system isn't based on the common good. It's based on
 money and keeping those in power in that money. We could maintain our
 infrastructure, simulate possible dangerous scenarios and how to deal
 wtih them and build in failsafes and redundencies but why do
 that. All it wall do is maybe save lives or make sure people have
 clean water to drink and air th breath but it's cheaper and more
 profitable to behave irresponsibly.

 Sorry, that's not particularly uplifting but that is America.

 Another big takeaway Thirsk talks of the importance of "non technical
 competencies" which is a *much* better term for soft skills and that
 there are all sorts of important things to learn during the college
 experience beyond the classroom. No argument there.

 Finally, Thirsk talked about the influence of educators. Something
 I've [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/forgot/][written about]] before. He told of how Mrs. Shirly Cole, his third
 grade teacher took time out from class to play a radio broadcast on
 John Glenn's launch into space. Mrs. Cole didn't remember this years
 later but it had a huge impact. Thirsk went on to talk of other
 educators and how they had impacts.

 This is something worth remembering. Sure, we teach CS - loops,
 conditionals and the like but sometimes it can be a little something
 else that has greatest impact.

 As I said, it was an interesting choice to select a non educator no
 CS person but it was a strong keynote and I enjoyed it immensley.

 At the coffe break I barely got to any vendors as I ran in to some
 friends. I'm writing this while listening to a session on the ACM
 2023 CS Curriculumm (Beta). I'm not getting a whole lot out of this
 session, hence writing the post. I'll probably talk a bit about this
 session though in a later post.
