Passing another miletone on the way to retirement this week. I didn't
think it would be this many steps - I figured I'd say I'm retiring,
fill out a form, and be done.

It turns out it's a multi stage process.

This week, my contract with Hunter officially ends and as of Friday
I'm on Travia leave - that's terminal leave to public school
teachers. I basically get full pay and benefits while my reserved sick
days get used up at a 2 sick for one real day rate. In about 2 weeks, I can
finally file my retirement forms and then on Dec 4th or so, it's all
over.

More importantly, my replacements are now both, well, in place.

On the Daedalus honors undergraduate CS side, Hunter hired my
replacement about month ago. A terrific instructor who already, as an
adjunct has proven herself both in terms of teaching and also in
connecting with her students. She's terrific but we only knew each
other because we were both at Hunter. I have no doubt that she'll take
the Daedalus program to the next level but due to personal
connections, I'm more excited about the new hire for my education
school work.

On that side, to run Hunters CS Teacher Education programs, they've
brought on Edgar Troudt. Edgar's spent a good amount of his career in
the CUNY system but has also made stops at LIU and Vaughn
College. Like my Daedalus successor, Edgar is a highly regarded
classroom teacher, is a strong computer scientist and brings a lot of
extras to the table.

For me though, it's extra special because I've known Edgar for
years. Back in the day, he was in my CS classes when he was a student
at Stuyvesant (note: I was not on the hiring committee so other than
telling Edgar and a few other people to apply, I had nothing to do
with the process). Since then, we've become friends and we've
worked together on a couple of projects.

I'm particularly excited because Edgar brings things to the position
that I lacked. We both have strong CS backgrounds but where my other
strength is K12 education and pipeline from start to industry, Edgar's
spent his career not only creating but more importantly growing
programs with a focus on entrepreneurship.

That background in program growth is what Hunter and in fact, NY needs
now. I planted the seed and got things off the ground but now the
program needs someone adept at growth and sustainability and that's
a special that Edgar brings to the table. I started the Masters in
CS Ed program but it's in a seedling state. A handful of students a
year. The next step for Hunter is to nurture it and grow it. At the
same time, the advanced certificate program will probably see reduced
demand but I've written on that before.

What gets me excited about Hunter's programs futures is that the
person they chose to succeed me has the unique skill set to take the
programs to the next levels. Something that maybe I could have done,
maybe I couldn't but passing the torch to someone with  a history of
program growth is the right move.

Nine years ago, it was time for me to leave Stuyvesant. I had done my
thing there, for better or worse and it was time for someone else to
take the reins. There and then it was JonAlf who I describe as being
very similar to me but with a better big picture view and a higher
upside. He hasn't disappointed in the role. I was happy then that he
succeeded me and just as delighted now. Same with Edgar.

I left Stuy confident that I left the program there in better
hands. Now that my successors at Hunter are both in place, I feel the
same way.
