Here's the first video in my learning elisp series.

Elisp is a lisp variant embedded within the Emacs editor. You could
actually describe Emacs as an "elisp machine" in the same sense of the
old [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine][lisp machines]]. It's not quite the same as the way most other
editors have extension or plugin languages. Other than the core of
Emacs, which is written in C, everything is elisp. Even when you type
in a key. For example, when I type in an 'x' on the keyboard, emacs
actually runs the self-insert-command function. When you open a new
file, which you might do in another editor using the File menu, you
actually are running the find-file function in elisp. So instead of
using the menu or the keybinding to open a new file you can write, in
emacs (find-file "some-file") and run that function and the file will
be opened.

In the video, I talk a bit about elisp in general, show how to call
some built in functions, use the help a bit and then set the stage for
the rest of the series.

Important functions and keybindings from the video:

| Key     | Function             | Description                          |
|---------+----------------------+--------------------------------------|
| C-h i   | info                 | bring up the info (help) system      |
| C-h k   | describe-key         | bring up info for the next keystroke |
| C-h f   | describe-function    | bring up help for a function         |
|---------+----------------------+--------------------------------------|
| C-x C-e | eval-last-sexp       | evaluates the previous elisp form    |
|         | eval-print-last-sexp | like above but also print the result |


In the next video, we'll learn how to create our own functions,
explore some fundamental elisp structures and functions, and try to
write something useful.

Here's the video, enjoy:
