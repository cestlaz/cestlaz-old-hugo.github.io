We finished up the trip with a few days in Amsterdam. Sitting in our
hotel now writing this post and trying not to stress out over the
elections until it's time for dinner.

Getting to town was a little hectic. Turns out there was a train with
some mechanical issues on the line so two thirds of the trains into
Amsterdam from Leiden were crowded. It only slowed us down by about a
half hour but it was a little hectic and much more crowded than I
would have liked.

Since we had most of the day, after dropping our bags at the hotel we
explored one of Amsterdam's street markets. The [[https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/whats-on/calendar/shopping/markets/ten-katemarkt][Ten Katemarkt]] in
particular.

Of course, Devorah wasted no time in finding yarn and fabric
stores.

A Dutch specialty appears to be Speculoos cookies - think Biscoff
cookies you get on planes. One particular version is the Gevulde
Speculaas which is an almond paste filled version. We got a
particularly tasty one at the market.

We spent the rest of the day wandering through the city, through
Voldelpark and eventually getting back to our hotel.

Had dinner at the [[https://www.blinqueen.com/][Blin Queen]] which is a pancake restaurant by day and
a really nice dinner restaurant in the evenings though we did get a
great pancake there for dessert.

Next day was another walking tour. It was a bit of a
disappointment. It randomly turned out to be the same tour guide as
the one Batya and I toured with last year and then he was great. This
time, not so much. I'd like to attribute it to just a bad day. In the
afternoon we hit the [[https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/whats-on/calendar/shopping/markets/albert-cuypmarkt][Albert Cyupmarkt]] - Amsterdam's largest street
market. Also great stuff there. I think visiting the two markets were
the highlights of the trip.

To close the day we found Amsterdam's Beguinage:

Though here it's called a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begijnhof,_Amsterdam][Begijnhof]]. We noticed it on Google maps and
decided to check it out.

Next up, museum day. First back to the Rijksmuseum which is truly
amazing and then an afternoon canal boat tour with Those Dam Boat Guys
which was fun.

Between the two activities we went to [[https://www.decarrouselpannenkoeken.nl/en/][The Carrousel Pancake House]] -
recommended last year by a friend.

That brought us to yesterday morning when we visited the Ann Frank
House. We also did the introductory program. Both were very
impactful. Walking though the house and going up to the secret annex
you can't help but get emotional.

We also ended up randomly finding our way to the Netherlands National
Holocaust Memorial which was also moving.

And finished out the day in the Amsterdam Museum.

Today's our last day in Amsterdam - we're flying home tomorrow
morning. Our first visit today was the Straat museum.

A really cool place. We had to take a ferry from Amsterdam Centraal to
get there but it was a nice ride and free. The museum is dedicated to
street art and you just get consumed being surrounded by all these
giant pieces. Really great museum.

Last up was the H'Art museum for an exhibition of Kadinsky's work on
loan from the Pompidou Center. Lots of great works but what got me
were his earlier non abstract works. I had no idea he started with
stuff like that.

Now all that's left is a dinner, a breakfast and a long flight. It's
been a great trip but I'm looking forward to getting home.
