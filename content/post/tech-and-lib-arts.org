Last night, I gave a talk to this years [[https://hackny.org/][HackNY]] fellows. It was a lot
of fun. I was originally going to speak about liberal arts and tech
education but I was asked to do something more on my professional
journey as a teacher so I did that. Had a great time but figured I'd
write about the liberal art stuff here anyway.

Over the last few months, I've noticed a surge in social media pushing
the humanities in CS education. This has mostly been a reaction to the
recent AI craze, chatGPT and related ethical concerns. This doubles
down on the ethics based push for more humanities resulting from all
of the plain as day ethic issues in the tech world.

I say surge but it's all relative. I haven't seen major initiatives to
change CS programs or anything like that, just more buzz.

Personally, I've been on the humanities bus for a long time. Going all
the way back to when I went to a liberal arts school as opposed to an
engineering school. Here, I'm not going to talk about the humanities
specifically with respect to ethics or ai, the issues du jour, but rather
what I've always spoken out on - their value to a student following a
tech path. I'm also not going to talk about the teaching side of
things. I'll save that for another day.

On one side, a side that's been covered for years is the whole cross
and interdisciplinary thing. Even before CS was big in K12 there were
plenty of efforts of including STEM in humanities classes and the
humanities in STEM classes. Makes sense. The whole silo thing that
we've evolved into works in some cases but is lacking in so many
more. For tech, the truth, contrary to most college CS programs is
that most CS majors will apply CS to some other field and not go on to
get PhDs. This means that having CS students with deep exposure to
other fields is a good thing. It's also easy - opportunities abound
just by choosing the right problems to explore. One I love is the
[[https://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#https://www.netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Biology/Termites.nlogo][termite gathering]] model in NetLogo. On it's own, it explores just
that - termites gathering woods as an emergent behavior. Beyond that,
though, I've read articles describing the same model as an exploration
of things as widely disparate as galaxy formation and wealth distribution.

The other side, and more interesting one as far as I'm concerned is
the value of a liberal arts education to a CS major ignoring the
above interdisciplinary utility. Disclaimer- I'm going to talk a bit
about the differences in a liberal arts education vs a more
engineering one (for lack of a better term). This does *not* mean that
individuals educated in one way are necessarily in any way lacking in
the other. That comes down to the individual.

I was once talking to two of my closest friends, independently about
this. Changing names to ensure privacy, let's call my friend educated
in a liberal arts school Liberal Arts Larry and my engineer friend,
Engineering Ed.

Talking about his education, Ed was able to pinpoint where he learned
specifically useful things for his career. "I really got Fourier
Transformations when a Took blahblahblah" or "automata really made
sense after I took compilers."

Larry on the other hand described his experience by saying "I really
can't say anything specific in any of my core (liberal arts) courses
but as a whole they've shaped who I am today and at some fundamental
level they inform so many of my decisions."

Interesting difference, at least between these two. Also, I would be
remiss if I didn't mention that Ed is very well red in the classics,
and knowledgeable in music and the arts and on the other side Larry is
as strong technically as anyone I know. At the same time, both were CS
majors and both have been very successful over their careers.

We can drill down more on Larry's statement to really think about
how liberal arts, if taken by a student ready for them, shine. High
School students frequently tell me they want to work on games. They
think they need all the science and math, and to a certain extent,
they might, but I ask them, what is a game really? It's a
story. Playing a game is being a player in a story. Every game I can
think of, save one [fn:1] tells a story. Story telling is liberal
arts. Other aspects that might influence a young individual embarking
on their tech career? How about psychology - how people
thing. Certainly a boon in understanding your users and pitching a
solution. In a similar vein, anthropology. Okay, maybe not the bone
digging side of physical anthro but certainly cultural anthropology -
how groups of people live - customs, cultures, taboos
etc. Understanding people is not part of a CS curriculum but it's
layered all over the humanities. Of course literature and writing
quite literally is story telling and art and related fields as well
and even history, particularly if it's not just a collection of facts
but more  cause and effect based. 

In short, at least in my opinion, unless you're really going down the
engineering side rabbit hole a liberal arts education can be super
beneficial to students moving into tech and so many dismiss BA
offering schools in favor of a BS. This isn't even getting to the
ethics and AI side of things but, as I said up top - that's for another post. 

The catch with all of this, though, is that the student must be ready
for a liberal arts education. Our society pushes really hard on the
"college is for jobs only" button and while I've argued that a BA can
in fact be better for a tech career in many cases many dismiss the
idea. How many students look for the easiest distribution requirements
and take their liberal arts classes in a vacuum - only about the class
itself as opposed to how it can grow them as a person. In my
experience, most colleges don't help matters with professors self
silo-ing their subjects making matters worse. If a student doesn't
approach  a liberal arts education with the right attitude and
investment, much of the value can be lost.

Still, I hope that the pendulum will swing and more people will see
how a tech education without the humanities is only half an
education. I've been talking about it for years. I hope others start
to do the same.
