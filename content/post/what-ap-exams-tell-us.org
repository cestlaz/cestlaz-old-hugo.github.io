I wanted to get back to my post on the "hard" [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/acps-a-hardest-question/][AP
question]]. Specifically I wanted to reflect on what AP exams can and
can't actually tell us and what purpose they serve, can serve, or
should serve.

First let's make sure we're on the same page about what the College
Board is offering - they offer single end of semester high stakes
exams. These exams provide a single number between 1 and 5 that, in
theory, signify how well an exam taker knows the subject. As it
happens, many colleges award either credit, placement or both if
students score high enough.

I'm emphasizing that the college board's offerings are exams because
that's really the only thing that's different or special about
them. Calculus existed long before the college board and while
calculus classes in high school and college vary around the edges, the
topic matter is essentially the same. If you teach calculus with or
without the college board you're probably teaching more or less the
same thing. Same for APCS-A which, while usually taught over the
course of a full year, is largely similar to a college CS1
class. APCS Principles and possibly other courses are not facsimiles
of college courses (and in fact, in my opinion, APCS-P is not college
level) but even then, the unique part of the College Board's offering
is the exam. Over the past decade, many colleges have designed or
redesigned their CS0 offerings. I personally, designed a CS0 for
Stuyveasnt that became a required class in the late 1990s and I think
it's much stronger than APCS-P. Other HS teachers have done
similar. Even with APCS-P, there are numerous independent businesses
and organizations offering their own APCS-P curricula.

So, at the end of the day, the College Board does one thing - offers
and grades a high stakes exam. These exams also are limited in
format. Multiple Choice and long answer questions are the norm. Long
answer might be an essay in some subjects or word problems in math or
science. In CS, they're generally programming questions. Some exams
might have additional components such as the activities that APCS-P
students do in class which are then submitted for evaluation but we're
going to stick to APCS-A here.

So, what can and can't the exam do?

To start, it's a single exam at the end of the semester. There's no
feed forward from current teachers and no feedback afterwards for the
students. The exam has to be totally self contained. Since the student
teachers had nothing to do with the creation of the exam, don't
proctor it, and in fact can't be around the administration, everything
about the questions has to be in the questions. No ambiguity at
all. This can frequently lead to the "wall of text" problem I talked
about in the earlier post.

Since it's a coarse instrument, it also has to try to capture a range
of results that will map to the final grades between 1 and 5. This
means you want to try to avoid all or nothing questions where a test
taker either aces the question or gets a 0. The hope is that if they
know some concepts leading to a solution they can get some credit.

This, and the format leads to a test of, in my opinion, limited value.

Half the test is multiple choice. Multiple choice questions don't
usually lend themselves to deep thinking questions. They're more
suited to rules, regurgitation, and mechanics. You'll see trace
through the code questions, know the rules questions and definition
questions. These take time but measure mechanics and memory, not
problem solving.

Free response isn't much better.  You can find past questions
[[https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/exam/past-exam-questions][here]]. Most of the questions are very wordy which is a challenge to
both native English speakers and English language learners but the
questions usually either spell out in detail step by step what to do
or the solution for each part is arrived at by either using a small
number of calls defined earlier in the question or come from a
provided reference such as the ArrayList reference. I looked over the
2021 exam and indeed two of the questions spell out the solutions and
the other two use the calls from the reference or the question.

In general, just like the multiple choice, the free response questions
don't really test problem solving. They test reading comprehension and
a knowledge of the mechanics of fundamental programming. It's coding
not computer science.

Sometimes it gets a little ridiculous. One year, back in the APCS-AB
days there was a question that was essentially a mergesort but the
question itself was a writeup of the psuedocode in outline form.

On the flip side, there sometimes is a deep thinking question. The
very first year APCS was offered there was a question that essentially
asked the design of a data structure to store a sparse matrix. I took
that exam and I'm sure I got that one wrong. It wasn't easy but it
required problem solving. The problem with those types of questions is
that they're all or nothing and the College Board, even with the types
of questions they use receives far too many blank solutions.

So that's the test - it's a test of programming mechanics, rule
familiarity, and reading. The truth is, that it probably has to be
this way. A teacher throughout a year can assess a student in a
variety of ways and should know their students and where they are
at. Some assessments might cover mechanics and memory but others the
deeper concepts. It's why, when I decided where to place my incoming
Hunter freshmen, I didn't care about their AP scores. For APCS-P
because the class is super uneven - I've met APCS-P students with
strong backgrounds and others who would have been better of with
nothing at all in terms of CS learned. For APCS-A, I know plenty of
students who earned a low score who ended up doing great things in
CS - since the vast majority of my students were NYC students, I
generally knew their CS teachers and the classes they taught - that's
what I went with.

For the AP exam? How valuable can a 5 value scale be in communicating
what a student knows? Going back to my last post, while the 2D free
response question had the lowest scores but apparently students scored
well on the 2D array multiple choice questions. Which is it?

So there it is - high stakes tests are not only bad due to the
pressure they place kids under but also because they come down to a
single number and a single number in no way can represent a
student. Even worse, high stakes exams are very frequently, and I
don't know if the college board follows this practice, first scored to
a rubric and then after the fact the raw scores are mapped to a final
grade. This is a key way New York State manipulates test scores and passing
rates to suit their needs.

This is just one of the reason I'm down on the College Board - better
for high schools to partner with local colleges and offer dual credit
classes. Teach college stuff and get real college credit - not a
number between 1 and 5.
