Yesterday, someone posted [[https://njctl.org/teacher-education/programs/computer-science-mstl/][this link]]  to the various CS teacher groups
on Facebook. A Masters program in teaching CS. As I usually do, I took
a look. I've spoken before about the variation of quality in teacher
certification programs across all subjects. Some are great but many
(*many*) are bad. I blame this largely on NCLB but that's for another
day. For CS I've lamented that while I'd like to think that my program
is strong and I know there are programs like [[https://catalog.siena.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=5&poid=1228][Siena's]] that are great
but there are others both in NY State and out that are quite frankly,
certificate mills. It appears to me that the NJCTL program is one of
those so I thought this was a good opportunity to dissect the program
as described by their web page.

First - two notes. On each of the posts on Facebook someone responded
calling the institutions accreditation into question - I don't know about this one
way or another so I won't speak to that.

Second - I'm only responding to the website based information. I
haven't spoken to anyone in the program and therefore could be offbase
on some things. Still, I'll be sharing my initial impressions and
opinions and barring any new information, well, you know.

Okay. Let's go.

The program is online asynchronous. My program is online with a mix of
sync and async. I think in person is better for some classes but as
long as we're the only adv cert program running in the state, we have
to be online to accommodate teachers who live or teach far away. I do
think that being entirely async is a problem for a teaching
program. The program seems to have online discussion groups But I
don't think alone that's enough.

Still, the format wasn't really what attracted my attention when I
perused the program site.

The first class is "Secondary PSI Teaching Methods for Compuer
Science." Okay, sounds good but since it's cross listed for all the
other curricula areas they offer and the syllabus doesn't seem to
mention any CS this is not a great start.

Next there's a course in "learning and teaching programming in
Python." The title is reminiscent to math ed classes like "Geometry
for math teachers" - when this is offered by an academic department
rather than as an education course it's historically code for "watered
down math since real math might be too hard." In this case, I wouldn't
come down too hard since it's an intro programming experience so it's
probably fine.

Finally, phase 1 ends the "Learning and Teaching General Computing
Concepts." Fine but it seems pretty shallow for a 3 credit graduate
level course and while it's coded as a CS class (CSCI), if the program
was meatier, the relevant concepts would probably appear in other more
worthwhile courses.

Phase 2 has three courses. One is field experience and since the
syllabus being general for all subject areas I couldn't really
determine if the class is legit or not. The other two Phase 2 classes
were basically "APCS-P for teachers" parts 1 and 2, three credits
each.

Okay, here we have a problem. First off, APCS-P isn't a college level
class to begin with again we're having a CSCI class about how to teach
CS with early high school CS content. Not good. It really rings of
weekend PD stretched out for 3 credits. If a teacher actually knows
their CS, they shouldn't have to actually take a class in APCS-P.

Phase 3? More field experience with the same concerns and 2 semesters
of "APCS-A for teachers." This might be worse. APCS-A content is early
level undergraduate CS that's usually taught in 1 semester. Here it's
taught as it is in HS over a full year.

By contrast, my program provides self study for very rudimentary
programming and our first course is APCS-A with all the other ones
being more advanced and all content. We then also have our methods and
curriculum classes on top of that. We don't spend a year on APCS-P or
APCS-A but you can bet my grads teaching HS will be able to teach
either along with a wide range of other classes. 

The final class is basically prep for the praxis exam so are they
saying that a good practice for a teacher prep program is a test prep
class for a standardized exam?

I couldn't find out more but these were my personal impressions. I
looked at all the syllabi and all had faculty listed on the top but I
sure hope those aren't the actual faculty because all but I think 1
don't appear to have any CS background (based on looking them up on
LinkedIn).

Before going on, I want to state that I'm just sharing my impressions
for information - this program doesn't compete with my program since
it's not NY State approved and besides, I just retired so it's not
technically my program anymore anyway.

Continuing, I thought this was worth writing up because there are
plenty of other programs like this and including some in NY State (and some that
I think, shockingly, the state approved as certification
programs). These are programs to look out for. It's also CS Ed going
the way of all Ed.

When I got my math certification, I needed a certain number of math
credits and back then there wasn't, or at least, I wasn't aware of the
"math ed" alternatives. When I got my license in NY City, I had to
face a "board of examiners" - a principal, a math chair, and some math
teachers who could grill me both on math and how to teach it. A couple
of years the city stopped certifying teachers and just followed the
state's lead. After that NCLB was enacted and all of a sudden instead
of having to actually know your content you could complete a "math
ed," "sci ed," or other "ed" program. This opened the door for severely
watered down content. In fact, before I got my Masters (in straight CS from the
Courant Institute at NYU), I had colleagues list out programs where I
could get my masters and my 30 above (for increased salary). Everyone
knew which programs you'd learn stuff but had to work in and which
ones were basically pay for the credits, sit back, and relax (and
yes, I did in fact take a couple of those courses as well to round out
my 30 above).

It seems that we're going down the same road with CS Ed.

If you're a teacher seeking to add CS certification or even take
classes to improve your CS knowledge or pedagogical content knowledge,
buyer beware. There are some great classes out there and great
programs but there's also a lot of low level PD masquerading as deep
content.

Sorry if this pisses some people off but you know me, I'm New York's
resident CS curmudgeon. If I don't rant about these things, who will?
