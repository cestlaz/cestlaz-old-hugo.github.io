So, I went for my walk yesterday and indeed was able to settle on a
topic for my HackNY talk next week.

HackNY is, for lack of a better description, a support system for
tech interns in NYC. It started 12 years ago. Back then, a college
student would apply to HackNY. If accepted, they would be matched with
a NY based tech startup and they'd be housed, I believe in the NYU
dorms. HackNY would provide a number of common activities beyond
communal living - talks and other events. Big tech companies like
Google were already offering housing, guest talks, and special events
both  social and technical. HackNY sort of did this across the nY
tech startup space. You'd intern at whatever small company that could
provide a great internship experience and HackNY provided the out of
office side.

It also served as a recruitment and advertising tool for NY Tech which
was just developing back then.

Tech in NY and the startup scene is very different now and as a
result, according to the HackNY
website, the program's changed since then - they still provide
the housing, talks and events but no longer provide the
internships. The student must find that on their own prior to starting
with HackNY over the summer. It could be awesome, with HackNY
providing a nexus for these students who might otherwise be floating
without much support - particularly those interning at very small
companies or it could be that something's lacking without HackNY
curating the internship experiences. We'll see. 

Anyway, what should I, a career teacher, have to say to these
students. Sure, I have a unique view - I've worked in industry and I
think I'm one of the few people out there who's both strong as a
teacher and technically who's experienced in working with populations
from elementary school all the way well into the workplace but this
isn't a room of aspiring teachers.

These kids will still be in college next year, and maybe for three
more years. I thought, maybe I should talk about the liberal
arts. Sure, Humanities in tech has gotten a little buzz in the last
few years, first due to ethical issues and now because of AI but I've
been talking about why the liberal arts are important for tech majors
for far longer.

So, I outlined a talk on my walk and now I have to flesh it out. Sure,
I'll talk a bit about the education scene, I think as New York's CS
Education Curmudgeon I have to complain about that. I'll also talk
about the ethics and AI issues but the focus will be on something more
fundamental. How CS relates to the liberal arts from the humanities
point of view and how studying liberal arts can enhance a tech person.

Devorah and I will be heading to Philadelphia tomorrow for a brief
vacation (what is it, we won second place or something in a
contest [fn:: You know the old joke, the prize for the sweepstakes was
one week in Philladelphia, second prize, two weeks :-)] but then I'll
flesh it out. If the talk goes well, I'll write it up sometime
afterwards. If not, I'll probably still write it up but it'll probably
be more humorous.
