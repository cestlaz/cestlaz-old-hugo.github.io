* Nifty
http://nifty.stanford.edu/
These are assignments not lessons (or lectures as Parlante  said)
Because assignments can be memorable
I think lessons/units should be memorable

used to be all graphics up the app
and last few years didn't do it
this year better range - graphics, sounds, real world data, games

Not one modality will talk to all students (in spite of what some
presenters said) so it's good to have a big catalog of choices and to
use different ones in a given class.

Session is still fun but less important because Nifty has really set
up a good format and web  site.

microteaching and it seemed like a good idea are more about the
teaching side and aren't captured as well in a web site.
