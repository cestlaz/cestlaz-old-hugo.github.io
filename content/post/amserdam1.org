Final leg of the trip in Amsterdam. Train ride and hotel went smoothly
but we were hungry so got a quick bite across from the Rembranthuis

After some wandering

we found our way to the [[https://www.verzetsmuseum.org/][WWII Dutch Resistance Museum]].

Great place to go if you want to be both proud and inspired and
depressed at the same time.

It contained propaganda from both sides

and relayed the horror and tragedy that occurred during the Holocaust
highlighting the brave acts of many to try to save lives as well as
the stories of those who acquiesced and for the most part, regretted
it.

It left an impact and if you're in Amsterdam I highly recommend it,
particularly give the direction of things with the Republicans in the
United States these days.

Dinner after that was a real treat. Batya and I got dinner with my old
student Artem.

Artem graduated Stuy in I think 2000 and I was marginally in touch but
hadn't seen him since the early part of this century. When I announced
to my alumni community that I was heading to the Netherlands and
asking for recs, Artem chimed in and we coordinated. Such a treat to
reconnect with a former student in person. To be able to see him doing
well in life so many years later.

We got dinner at Entrepot and it was one of the best meals I've had in
years.

That was it for day 1.

Day 2 started with another Sandeman tour. Got an overview of the city
and learned some interesting things. One stood out. We learned about
these [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolperstein][Stumbling Stones]]

placed in front of houses

memorializing victims of the Holocaust. 

We also stopped by the former home of the Dutch West India Company

and talked about Dutch colonial times including New Amsterdam. It was
cool that our guide was into the Amsterdam/New Amsterdam thing and was
currently reading "The Island at the Center of the World" and had it
in his bag.

After that lunch at a pancake restaurant recommended by Artem. It was
in a repurposed carousel.

Next up the [[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl][Rijksmuseum]]. Many amazing artworks including
[[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl][The Night Watch]] but here is a less famous one.

All I can say is amazing place. Also props to the designers on the
wooden floors - much easier on the feet than stone.

As a final treat we saw [[https://www.grachtenrace.amsterdam/][De Grachtenrace Amsterdam]] - a rowing race in
the canals. We wanted to catcht it but didn't know exactly where or
when it was running - just the day. We saw around 20 boats race by
right after we left the museum

Batya and I did this type of rowing and racing withe the [[https://villagecommunityboathouse.org/][Village
Community Boathouse]] out of pier 40 when she was at Stuy.

That was it for our first couple of days in Amsterdam with a lot more
to come.
