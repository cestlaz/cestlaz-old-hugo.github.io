Devorah and I are finally on our first overseas retirement trip. Our
hope was to make up for lost travel time in retirement. We've already
gotten away a bit - a few days in Charlseton SC and a couple of local
driving trips but this is our first retirement biggie.

Started out in Paris. Left Monday evening and got in Tuesday at around
6:00am local time. Went right to the hotel. Stayed at the Hotel
Marignan on the Rue de Sommerard - a very reasonably priced hotel in
the Latin Quarter. Address given to differentiate from
the much more expensive Hotel Marignan on the Chams-Elysees. We took
the train into the city and rolled up to the hotel before 9:00am. Our
host at the hotel, Bridgette, was terrific. Took our luggage, signed
us in, asked if we wanted breakfast and once we were settled and
caffeinated, gave us the lay of the land and assured us our room would
be ready by noon (which it was). Can't recommend the hotel highly
enough. Nothing fancy but clean with a great staff. We opted for a
room with a toilet and shower but if you're comfortable with shared
facilities the rates are even better. I'll only add that the hotel has
six floors - that's seven flights of stairs since they zero index and
there's no elevator. Not a big deal for us but be aware.

Even though we had just landed, once we dropped our bags and had
breakfast we went forth and had a full day - a couple of museums, over
10 miles walking, and some good food.

Our first stop was the Rodin Museum and garden - that is the museum in
Paris and not his former home on the outskirts. We wanted to hit it
since we just recently visited the Rodin museum in
Philadelphia. The Paris museum is much larger. Many of the same
pieces - each have their "Gates of Hell," Assorted Burghers of
Callais, Balzac, and others but the Paris museum had more, also
included paintings and other media and was much more spacious and
expansive and since Devorah enjoys sculpture more than paintings,
which I prefer, this was time well spent.

After lunch we walked across the Siene and visited [[https://www.petitpalais.paris.fr/en/plan-your-visit/basic-information][le Petit
Palais]]. Great collection plus it's free.  After that we made our way
back to the hotel, rested up, got dinner then crashed for the
night. We ended up walking well over 20,000 steps, about 11 miles give
or take.

We were going to start the day with a tour but that wasn't going to
start until 11:00 so we had time to kill. We tarted with a critical
pilgrimage. We had to head over to the Sorbonne to view le Tour
Zamansky - yep, there's a tower named after a guy named Zamansky -
perhaps a relative of mine.

Marc Zamansky was the Dean of the Faculty of Sciences at the Sorbonne
up until 1970. He was also apparently a resistance fighter during
World War II. When we entered the campus, the security guard indicated
that we were not allowed to take pictures. I asked if he spoke English
and he said "non." I tried to explain in my really weak french that I
was a Zamansky and I showed him my ID. He laughed out loud and ushered
us in and even offered to take the picture. It was a nice moment all
around.

We then wandered the Luxembourg Gardens until tour time.

We usually try to do a free (tip only) walking tour whenever we visit
a new city and since we haven't been to Paris for 36 years, it was
basically new. I think we ultimately pay the same as if we do a normal
pay tour but these have worked for us. The tour was great and
informative and gave us the lay of the land.

For lunch we decided just to get sandwiches - cheaper and lighter than
a sit down lunch and the bread in Paris is amazing. Truth be told I
would have been happy just eating bread the whole trip. They also do
sandwiches right - not tons of meat and gobs of mayo. It's a slice of
ham, maybe a slice of cheese and a little butter on amazing bread.

Afterwards was the Muse D'Orsay. Here's the elephant out front.

Inside we found more elephants

But no Krafayis:

Really amazing museum.

For dinner we ended up at a restaurant with Basque options and I had a
great cassoulet:

We went a bit further afield on Thursday, our last full day in
Paris. We visited the Muse Marmottan de Monet. A converted house
museum that boasts a tremendous collection of Monet's work as well as
other impressionists.

They also had an exhibit on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trompe-l'%C5%93il][Trompe L'Oeil ]] - art with highly
realistic depictions of 3D space. Really cool.

Great museum - I highly recommend and it was much less crowded than
say the Muse D'Orsay. Afterwards we slowly made our way back to the
hotel.

If course we found the yarn store for Devorah:

And took a selfie as we passed the Eiffel Tower (but didn't go up):

The plan was to go to the Muse D'Orangerie which also boasts a strong
collection of Impressionists and Post Impressionists but the line was
too long and it looked too crowded so instead we went back to the
Sorbonne and to a small Marie Curie museum. It's a two room museum
plus you can look in on her lab and office. Really cool. Also 100%
recommend to fellow science nerds. As a bonus, it was free.

Finally on Friday we decided to visit the Cluny Museum - just a couple
of blocks from our hotel. It's a mansion museum boasting a tremendous
collection of art from the middle ages.

About a third of the museum was shut at the time of our visit but what
we saw was amazing. We'll certainly be back to see the rest.

After another sandwich lunch, this time in the Luxembourg gardens, we
stopped by at the hotel and then off to Gare de Nord - the train
station to take the Eurostar to Brussels.

That's where I am now writing this post. It's Saturday
afternoon. We're spending a few days in Brussels staying with a friend
so it'll be more visiting and less frantic touring. That said, we did
a walking tour this morning and have a couple of things lined up for
tomorrow and then Monday we'll be heading to Bruges for a day trip,
mostly because Devorah wants to check out the lace center there.

Great trip so far. Looking forward to the rest.
