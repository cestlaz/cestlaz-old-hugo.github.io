Back from my trip and ready to continue the elisp series.

Today we're starting our emoji project. When we're done we'll have a
minor mode where we can type in something like :elephant: in a buffer
and Emacs will replace it with the elephant emoji üêò. That's part
one. We'll then learn how to overlay the emoji over the text so that
while it will appear as the emoji (üêò) the actual text of :elephant:
will still be in the buffer and file if you save it. The former,
replacing the text with the emoji is useful if you actually want the
emoji in the file. I'm using it to create emoji based polls that I can
cut and paste into Slack or Zulip. The overlay idea is useful when you
want the emoji to display for visual effect but you don't want it in
the actual file.

There's no new elisp in this first video - we're going to put together
a function that sees if you type an emoji name before the current
point (cursor) and if so, replaces it with the emoji. The function
pulls together a lot of what was covered in earlier videos.

So, no code explanations here. The second video will deal with hooks -
the way we'll make this all happen "automatically" and then we'll
cover the overlays and then finally making minor mode and
configuration.

Enjoy.
