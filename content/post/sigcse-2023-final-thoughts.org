Time to wrap up the SIGCSE 2023 posts. Overall a great conference. The
exhibits room was felt a little sparse but from an attendee point of
view, not a big deal. Lots of great sessions and got to spend a lot of
time with some great people. My only semi-serious complaint would be
that this year, sessions were an all or nothing - that is, there were
time slots where I wanted to attend two or three sessions and then
others where very little appealed to me. I think that was just bad
luck on me though.

My big thought for this year was that the combination of [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/sigcse-2023-nifty/][Nifty
Assignments]], [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/sigcse-2023-microteaching/][Microteaching]], and [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/sigcse-2023-it-seemed-good-idea/][It seemed like a good idea at the time]]
combined to make a a really nice teaching track. Nifty will certainly
be there next year but I hope the other two are as well. Actually, I'd
really love to see some doubling down on all three of these sessions.

I'd love to see something like Nifty Assignments but for lessons,
including suggested pedagogical techniques (even though those can be
very circumstance dependent). Likewise, I'd love to see some "good
ideas at the time"s which were more about lesson ideas, exercises, or
motivations or possibly even lesson or unit topics.

For microteaching, I'd love to see a deeper dive into less obvious
practices. I wouldn't stop covering that basics as were highlighted
this year but I think a lot of people teaching don't realize how much
subtlety there can be in teaching. Even things like a teachers body
positioning and how they move in a classroom can be intentional and
for a specific effect.

I can't say 100% that I'll be there next year as I won't be teaching
(at least not full time) but right now I'm thinking I will be.

Now, to start figuring out what failure I should proposed to join in
on the "good idea at the time" session.
