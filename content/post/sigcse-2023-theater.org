I'll recount what I said a couple of posts earlier - I was speaking to
a HS teacher who I've known for a long time but was meeting in person
for the first time. It was his first SIGCSE. I asked how he was liking
it. His response was "well, there are a whole lot of professors who
really could use a class or two in pedagogy."

I'll go further to say that we always give extra value and credence
to those that come from elite institutions. It's just a reflection on
society - famous people are considered authorities and frequently
assert themselves as such. What does Bill Gates know about education?
Nothing, yet he's done more to drive education policies in America
than any ten teachers. David Coleman controls education through the
college board and "gifted" us with common core and how many years did
he teach? What about Wendy Kopp of Teach For America.

But I digress.

If something comes out of an elite institution it's good. Otherwise,
people are  skeptical. I can't tell you how many times I've heard a student
complain about something at Hunter, another CUNY, or a similar
institution but when I've heard students talk of similar or worse from
places like Stanford, Harvard, or CMU, it's always oh, those
institutions know how to do things.

All this leads up to more commentary on Harvard's CS50. In this
session David Malan, the course's creator and instructor was talking
about innovative ways of engagement that he used during Covid. Being
at Harvard, he had access to the American Repertory Theater to film as
well as a professional level props department.

It must be nice to have almost limitless resources.

Malan talked about ripping a phone book to demonstrate binary search,
using blocks and string for linked lists, swapping variables by
modeling with two cups filled with colored liquids then three. Linear
search with "let's make a deal" style doors and more.

All of these came with the expected level of glitz and showmanship.

Now, to be fair, most of the ideas presented were good ones, although
I'll suggest one I find better for linked list down below. No problem
with the presentation - I liked it - all good stuff. The thing that
made me sad is at the college level this is considered innovative. I
know teachers who were ripping phone books in the 80s. They were
teaching binary search for the first time but they knew how to use
manipulatives from day 1 as teachers. Same for most of the other
practices.

Malan did bring up the important question as to how much time one
should spend on these types of demos vs class materials and where's
the line but I think a richer presentation would have included an
instructor from a less well funded institution (or a HS teacher since
these ideas are old hat to them) providing the dollar store value version of
the Harvard production and they could have discussed if they were
equally effective or not.

So, while I have my curmudgeonly take that for a K12 teacher not much
here is new it is really good stuff. The paper is worth looking over
and at least for now, it's freely available [[https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3545945.3569859][here]].

To close things off, I wanted to talk about the linked list demo. It's
a nice but medium to high effort demo. Malan made physical blocks to
represent nodes and connected them with string. This could of course
be done more cheaply with, let's say cardboard bankers boxes but I
have another suggestion that worked better for me, although both are
good ideas.

It's actually the way I introduced linked lists prior to Covid when we
were in person.

Prior to class, I tell a subset of my  students a secret - who's after
them. In person, I'd pull them aside on entry, on Zoom I'd dm them.

I'd say:

- John, don't tell anyone but Beth is after you
- Sarah, don't tell anyone but Jean is after you
- Beth, don't tell anyone but Sarah is after you
- Jean, don't tell anyone but Harry is after you

Etc.

Now, sometime, students get worried and interpret "so and so is after
you" to mean that person is out to get them. An unintended
consequence, but it's always turned out to be an opportunity to have
some class fun.

Anyway, this is a linked list:

John->Beth->Sarah->Jean->Harry

I make it clear that each person can only know and remember two
things - who they are and who's next.

We can see that the list is distributed all over the class (or city on
Zoom) and we can perform operations on the list. We try an insert and
more often than not the person doing the insert does it in the wrong
order - hilarity ensues.

An instructor can go in all sorts of directions with this. It's fun
and actively involves the students. The demo is nice but I much prefer
this.

So, that's it for today some good practices, possibly innovative at
the college level but not at the HS one. Fun presentation and a paper
worth reading over.

Next I'll be writing up a session called Pedagogical Innovations. It
really had nothing to do with pedagogy, more about curriculum but it
too was a really good session.
