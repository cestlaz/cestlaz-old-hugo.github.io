The other day Natan told me about an upcoming NYC Ballet
production. A one act adaptation of Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake" along with
a ballet set to Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition." He thought
it would speak to me. Swan Lake for reasons we'll get to and the
Mussorgsky because he already knows I really like the piece but also
because this production highlights not the works of Viktor Hartmann as
the piano suite is about but rather of Wassily Kandinsky. He thought
I'd like it both for the irony and because I like Kandinsky's
stuff. Right on all counts.

Now, let's talk about Swan Lake and what about those data tricks.

TL;DR - there's all sorts of data out there and all sort of things
will scratch student itches. Not everything has to be earth shaking or
even serious in the slightest - read on to see what I'm getting at.

My mom really liked Swan Lake and always lamented over the fact that
it never got the love it deserved. The Nutcracker suite is an annual 
holiday season darling and even Sleeping Beauty gets more love. My mom
would always point out that Swan Lake was musically as beautiful and
wished it was produced more.

Now, in my family we don't refer to Swan Lake as Swan Lake. For us,
it's Dracula, the Ballet. Why? See below:

It also turns out that the same theme was used in the original "The
Mummy" with Boris Karloff:

And Murders in the Rue Morgue:

So Natan jokingly referred to the NYC Ballet card as "Drucula the
Musical and Pictures at an Exhibition but with Kandinsky."

Now Natan, who is know to go down some serious rabbit holes like [[https://seccorecit.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-many-mary-mallons.html][this
one]] on Typhoid Mary or [[https://seccorecit.blogspot.com/2020/04/these-are-9-most-common-causes-of-death.html][common causes of death in operas]], not to
mention thoughts on [[https://seccorecit.blogspot.com/2019/12/the-cinderella-problem.html][Cinderella]] and a regular expresison to identify
[[https://seccorecit.blogspot.com/2019/03/umileah-how-to-identify-disney-princess.html][Disney Princesses]]. He dove in.

This is where the data come in. It turns out you, or your students can
dive into practically anything these days. Natan decided to see the
history of performances of Swan Lake vs Tchaikovsky's more popular
Nutcracker and Sleeping Beauty. There wasn't much historical
information from Ballet companies - most big ones that currently exist
seem to have been formed in the late 1930s or beyond but he found that
while excerpts from Nutcracker and Sleeping Beauty were regularly
performed by orchestras at the turn of the 20th century, Swan Lake
wasn't. Swan Lake did, however get a bump in the early 1940s while the
others held fast and then Swan Lake waned.

Hmm. What was up with that.

Well, it turns out that Dracula came out in 1931 and the other two
movies a year later. All three featured Swan Lake. Could Dracula have
revived interest in Swan Lake? It's certainly possible. One would have
to explain the gap between the movie's release and Swan Lakes surge
but it is possible. Of course there's no evidence for causation but
it's fun to think about.

Well, that's it, a silly deep dive into a little data. Nothing serious
and nothing conclusive but silly and fun. Nothing wrong with your
students learning how to find and explore on similarly silly data
sets.
