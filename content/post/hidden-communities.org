Now that I'm not teaching CS every day, I find the desire to maybe
write about some other things. I've still got a bunch of CS and
education posts lined up, but for today, something different.

I was out for my morning run a couple of days ago. I usually leave my
apartment between 5:00 and 5:45, go to the Hudson River and run an out
and back. It's still pretty quiet at that time. When I leave later,
the park is much more filled with runners, running groups, and bike
commuters.

I'm heading south and walking north is an older couple. I
say older couple but let's be fair, They're probably around my age and
I'm just older than I care to admit although based on my current pace
and recovery time, I should know better.

We wave good morning to each other and keep on our way. A little
later, I see a younger man walking and running south (it was really
hot and humid). We cross paths regularly but since we were going in
the same direction and frequently wave, I slowed to join him. I said
that after waving high for a couple of years, we might as well learn
each other's names. We fist bumped, or rather he went for the bump, I
went for the handshake, we switched but then finally synced. So,
that's how I met Chris. We chatted for a few minutes - we both live in
Chelsea, how we both get an energy boost whenever we see our "running
buddies" in the morning, and also about some of the other early
morning runners we've met.

He named Vicky, who I've been waving to for three or four years. Then
I gave him Suki - the first person I started saying hello
to. Suki and I would cross paths near Stuy, her walking north, me
running south. She would greet *everybody* with a warm smile, a wave and
a strong Good Morning! After a while, I slowed my run one day to get
to know here. We also talked about Priscilla, the Mayor of Hudson
River Park - at least to us early risers. Priscilla would always be
walking or running on the path along with her magnificent dog
Buddy. Unfortunately, Buddy passed about a year ago. We both lamented
that we haven't seen Priscilla lately and we both hope it's because
our schedules have changed.

We talked of a few others and I noted that I really have to introduce
myself to that couple I passed earlier and then went we on to complete
our individual morning workouts.

I got to thinking about this community. It's not a normal
community. We don't all know each others names and really very little
about each other but every morning, or at least a few times a week
we've come to expect to see each other and greet each other with a
smile, a happy hello, or a thumbs up or some other encouragement. We
get a boost when we do but we grow concerned when we don't see our
morning amigos.

In New York, we don't have that small town everyone knows their neighbors
thing. Heck, I live in a 20 story apartment building and barely know
my neighbors. We also don't have neighborhood schools and the mom and
pop store everywhere is a dying breed. Yet, we still have these weird
little communities that crop up. I look forward to seeing my running
buddies again early tomorrow morning.
