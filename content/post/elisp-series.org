It's been quite some time since my last Emacs video. The lack of
content has been for two reasons. One was my overall feeling of
burnout and the other was that most of my videos involved looking at
new packages and I really wasn't playing with anything new.

Now that I've started my retirement the burnout is gone and I'm
starting to think about what my next adventures will be. As I start
figuring out the big picture I thought I'd get back to some Emacs
content.

What's on tap?

I'm thinking about a short series on elisp. Now, I'm no elisp master -
I've only done enough to get by but I think that could make for some
nice beginner content and I'm sure I can count on the Emacs community
to (in a nice way) tweak my content towards best practices.

The plan is to start from the basics and ultimately write a few
interesting functions. Maybe a minor mode or two. Probably nothing
hugely useful but something that will illustrate the concepts. That
said, I want the examples to be at least a little useful and not
totally contrived.

I also figure that I probably won't be doing laundry lists of
functions or going over all the different ways of doing things but
hopefully I can provide pointers and process so other elisp beginners
can find their way to the info they'll need for their specific
projects.

So, stay tuned and look for more Emacs content to come.
