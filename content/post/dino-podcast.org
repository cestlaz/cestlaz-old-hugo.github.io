I love talking shop but I don't have the opportunity to do so as much
now that I'm retired. So, when my former student [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/dino-beslic-1b761a63/][Dino Beslic]] emailed
me and asked if I wanted to be on his podcast, [[https://open.spotify.com/show/6dJKlNZKxdaN6D6yrtDHBq][The Dino Podcast]], I was
both honored and excited.

Dino was a student of mine in the early 2000s but we haven't been in
touch for years. I reached out to his brother Denis, also a student of
mine, in order to connect yet another student to him for a job
referral. Denis talked to Dino and that ended up in me being invited
on the show. Of course, I'm also excited about being reconnected with
both Denis and Dino.

Dino's a Tech CFO and investor and his podcast is about "business,
technology, and geopolitics."

The tech job market has been in a downturn for the past couple of
years and at the same time, we've seen a rise in AI an AI based
programming assistants and related technologies. Dino and I spent a
little over an hour talking about reasons for the downturn, if and how
AI and the downturn were affecting the market and education. We also
projected a bit into the future and made some recommendations for
youngsters starting out.

I particularly enjoyed the fact that we were talking about education
at the college level up into the workforce - most of my recent shop
talks have focused on K12 and while I'm passionate about my work
there, I've also done a lot with preparing students for the tech
workforce and navigating early careers and am wondering if that's an
area I'll go back to focusing on for my next adventure.

So, if you've got the time, check out the Dino Podcast. Here's a link
